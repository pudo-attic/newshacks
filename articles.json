The career of one of America's most popular celebrity chefs appears to be in ruins, after she admitted using racially-charged language and was fired by the Food Network.Deen was asked about her attitudes towards race during a deposition last month as part of a discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former employee of a restaurant she co-owns with her brother, Bubba Hiers, in Savannah, Georgia.According to records, the 66-year-old told an attorney that she had \"of course\" used \"the n-word\", though not for many years. She also said that she had considered hiring an all-black team of waiters as part of an old-style southern plantation theme for her brother's wedding in 2007, having been impressed by a visit to a restaurant where the \"entire wait staff was middle-aged black men, and they had on beautiful white jackets with a black bow tie\".Deen was scheduled to appear on NBC's Today Show on Friday to explain herself, but she pulled out shortly beforehand. She then released two online video apologies. \"Inappropriate, hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable,\" she said in the first, which was removed soon after being put on YouTube. \"I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I beg for your forgiveness.\"In the second video, Deen said she wants \"people to understand that my family and I are not the kind of people that the press is wanting to say we are \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Your colour of your skin, your religion, your sexual preference does not matter to me.\" But the Food Network issued a brief statement saying it will not renew her contract when it expires at the end of the month.\n\t\n\tKnown as the Queen of Southern Cuisine, Deen is infamous for her calorific creations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 typically fried and featuring generous use of ingredients such as sugar, butter and cheese. Her signature dish is The Lady's Brunch Burger: a hamburger topped with bacon and a fried egg with glazed doughnuts as the bun.In 2011 another TV chef, Anthony Bourdain, said in an interview with TV Guide that Deen's fatty cooking made her \"the worst, most dangerous person\" on the Food Network.She attracted criticism in January last year when she revealed she has Type 2 diabetes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and had kept the diagnosis quiet for three years while continuing to peddle her comfort food. On the same day, Deen announced her desire to promote healthy living as part of an endorsement deal with Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical company that makes diabetes medication.Deen rose from poverty to become a multimillionaire \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Forbes estimates her net worth at $17m. She began by starting a catering company selling lunches in bags to office workers, then opened a restaurant called The Lady and Sons in Savannah. Television appearances led to her own show, Paula's Home Cooking, which debuted on the Food Network in 2002. With her folksy manner and chirpy catchphrase \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \"Hey, y'all!\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she soon became a hit.She has a million Twitter followers, has authored 14 cookbooks that have sold more than eight million copies, and, according to her website, her bi-monthly magazine has a million-strong circulation. She has a range of kitchenware and her two sons, Bobby and Jamie, also have cooking shows on television.In a statement issued to CNN, Deen said: \"I have had the pleasure of being allowed into so many homes across the country and meeting people who have shared with me the most touching and personal stories. This would not have been possible without the Food Network. Thank you again. Love and best dishes to all of ya'll.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Celebrity chef pulls out of TV appearances and releases statements after reports of admissions made in lawsuit

Americans need to be \"on guard for abuses\" of power by the US government through its secret interception of emails and phone calls in the name of national security.In a question and answer session at a business dinner in Edinburgh, Clinton said the use of secret surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA) to intercept communications by foreign terrorists was justified.And the US system also required a warrant from intelligence courts, backed up by sufficient evidence, for any surveillance activities against people within the US.But he said it was crucial there was accountability and transparency in the use of surveillance and interceptions by agencies such as the NSA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an area which he said was \"blurry, grey and made people uncomfortable\".\"There's no question that it's subject to abuse if people lie to the courts or if the wrong people get hold of the information and try to use it to embarrass people, but that has pretty much always been the case. It's just we're so aware of it now,\" Clinton told his audience at the Scottish Business Awards.\"I believe the most important thing is that we have accountability. But I will say this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 freedom and security are not incompatible; they're mutually reinforcing.\"I think you're more secure if you have more freedom. Therefore I think we should be on guard for abuses of the use of technology by our government.\"He said his own experience from two terms as US president was that governments had a duty to use that technology against threats and opponents, who planned to kill civilians.\"I can tell you from when I served that we did \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and far more attacks were stopped than were pulled off,\" he said.New information technology, such as smartphones, had \"dramatically changed\" and shrunk the parameters of personal privacy but he warned that state security operations of this kind needed to be very closely monitored.\"So this is one of those areas, which in my opinion will always be blurry, grey and make people uncomfortable, and we wish we didn't even have to talk about it or deal with it. But freedom and security are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\"You can destroy freedom with false claims that you have to do it to make everybody secure, but usually when somebody's doing it, they don't give a rip about security, they're just trying to get more power.\"And so the key here is accountability, transparency and protection against use of information, inadvertently found, for other purposes.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Former president tells Scottish audience there needs to be accountability and transparency when surveillance is used", "article:author":

their personal electronic devices, as the Federal Aviation Administration moves towards allowing gate-to-gate use of music players, tablets, laptops, smartphones and other gadgets.Restrictions on cellphone calls and internet use and transmission are not expected to be changed.An industry-labor advisory committee was supposed to make recommendations next month to the FAA on easing restrictions on using electronic devices during takeoffs and landings. But the agency said in a statement on Friday that the deadline has been extended to September, because committee members asked for extra time to finish assessing whether it's safe to lift restrictions.\"The FAA recognizes consumers are intensely interested in the use of personal electronics aboard aircraft; that is why we tasked a government-industry group to examine the safety issues and the feasibility of changing the current restrictions,\" the statement said.The agency is under public and political pressure to ease the restrictions as more people bring their devices with them when they fly, in order to read e-books, listen to music, watch videos and get work done. Technically, the FAA doesn't bar use of electronic devices when aircraft are below 10,000ft. But under FAA rules, airlines that want to let passengers use the devices are faced with a practical impossibility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they would have to show that they have tested every type and make of device passengers would use, to ensure there is no electromagnetic interference with aircraft radios and electrical and electronic systems.As a result, US airlines simply bar all electric device use below 10,000ft. Airline accidents are most likely to occur during takeoffs, landings and taxiing.Using cellphones to make calls on planes is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. There is concern that making calls from fast-flying planes might strain cellular systems, interfering with service on the ground. There is also the potential annoyance factor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether passengers will be unhappy if they have to listen to other passengers yakking on the phone.Although the restrictions have been broadly criticized as unnecessary, committee members saw value in them. One of the considerations being weighed is whether some heavier devices like laptops should continue to be restricted because they might become dangerous projectiles, hurting other passengers during a crash, the committee member said. There is less concern about tablets and other lighter devices.\"It's good to see the FAA may be on the verge of acknowledging what the traveling public has suspected for years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that current rules are arbitrary and lack real justification,\" said Senator Claire McCaskill, one of Congress' more outspoken critics of the restrictions, in a statement. She contends that unless scientific evidence can be presented to justify the restrictions, they should be lifted.Edward Pizzarello, the co-founder of the frequent-flier discussion site MilePoint, said lifting the restriction was \"long overdue.\"\"I actually feel like this regulation has been toughest on flight attendants. Nobody wants to shut off their phone, and the flight attendants are always left to be the bad guys and gals,\" said Pizzarello.Actor Alec Baldwin became the face of passenger frustration with the restrictions in 2011, when he was kicked off a New York-bound flight from Los Angeles for refusing to turn off his cellphone. Baldwin later issued an apology to fellow American Airlines passengers who were delayed, but mocked the flight attendant on Twitter.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Use of music

Care was taken to ensure the condition of the former president was not affected, it added.The anti-apartheid leader remains in serious but stable condition in a hospital, according to the office of President Jacob Zuma. The government confirmed reports about transport problems when the former leader was taken to the hospital for what officials have said is a recurring lung infection. CBS News reported that Mandela had to be transferred in wintertime temperatures to another ambulance in the early morning of 8 June after waiting on the side of the highway for 40 minutes.The government said in a statement that doctors are satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize laureate suffered \"no harm\" at the time. Mandela was taken from his home in the Johannesburg neighborhood of Houghton to a hospital in Pretoria, the capital, about 31 miles away.\"The fully equipped military ICU ambulance had a full complement of specialist medical staff including intensive care specialists and ICU nurses. The convoy also included two quick response vehicles,\" the presidency said. \"When the ambulance experienced engine problems it was decided that it would be best to transfer to another military ambulance which itself was accompanied for the rest of the journey by a civilian ambulance.\"The statement added: \"All care was taken to ensure that the former president Mandela's medical condition was not compromised by the unforeseen incident.\"In recent days, reports from the government, former President Thabo Mbeki and a grandson of Mandela have indicated that the health of Mandela is improving, although he has been in the hospital for treatment several times in recent months.Close family members have been visiting him daily in a Pretoria hospital amid an outpouring of prayers and messages of support from South Africans and people around the world. Zuma's office appealed for Mandela's privacy to be respected \"and that he be accorded the doctor-patient confidentiality that all patients are entitled to in terms of medical ethics.\"On 29 April , state television broadcast footage of a visit by Zuma and other leaders of the ruling African National Congress to Mandela's home. Zuma said at the time that Mandela was in good shape, but the footage - the first public images of Mandela in nearly a year - showed him silent and unresponsive, even when Zuma tried to hold his hand.The ANC said on Saturday that the presidential reports on Mandela's condition have ensured that \"we are all kept up-to-date and knowledgeable about his condition\" within the limits of privacy and medical confidentiality.\"The African National Congress once again calls upon all concerned parties including the media to afford President Mandela and his family respect and privacy during this difficult time,\" the statement said.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "The emergency vehicle carrying the former president suffered engine trouble two weeks ago but his care was not

over Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who admitted leaking top secret spying documents.As Snowden landed in Moscow after leaving Hong Kong, where the US had requested his arrest, leading Democratic senator Chuck Schumer accused the Russian president of sticking a finger in the eye of the US. \"The bottom line is very simple: allies are supposed to treat each other in decent ways and Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran and now of course with Snowden,\" Schumer said on CNN's State of the Union. \"That's not how allies should treat each other and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.\"Mike Rogers, chairman of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, told NBC's Meet The Press that he did not have information that Putin had prior knowledge of Snowden's flight plans but \"it wouldn't surprise me\". \"Putin has been planting a thorn in the world's side in Syria. We think they may not be playing honest with respect to the nuclear treaty. They are very aggressive around the world,\" he said. \"I'm sure they would love to have a little bit of coffee and some conversation with Mr Snowden.\"He added that the US should use \"every legal avenue\" to bring Snowden back to the US. \"We will continue with extradition activities wherever he turns up.\"Rogers said the leaks had damaged national security and \"bad guys overseas have changed the way they operate\" as a result of the leaks.Republican senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News that Russia should \"hold this fellow and send him back here for justice\".\"I don't think he's a hero, I believe he hurt our nation. He compromised the national security program designed to find out what terrorists were up to,\" he said.However, amid the backlash against Russia, politicians and others also rounded on the Obama administration. Graham questioned why Snowden was allowed to leave Hong Kong in the first place. \"I'd like to find out why our papers were not in compliance. That would be a big mistake by the Department of Justice,\" he said.Republican senator Rand Paul attacked national intelligence director James Clapper, who earlier this month admitted to gibing the \"least untruthful\" answer to Congress when asked about the extent of US surveillance of American citizens.Paul told CNN: \"I think it is still going to be an open question with history about how this young man is judged. I do think when history looks at this they are going to contrast the behaviour of James Clapper, our national intelligence director, with Edward Snowden. Mr Clapper lied in Congress in defiance of the law in the name of security. Mr Snowden told the truth in the name of privacy.\" He said both had broken the law.On Saturday House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi was booed by a crowd during a speech at activist meeting Netroots Nation when she said Snowden had broken the law. Pelosi was heckled as she spoke about the need to balance privacy and security. One man yelled: \"It's not a balance, it makes us less safe.\" Another shouted: \"You suck!\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Senator warns Vladimir Putin of 'serious consequences' if

Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo Bay, according to fresh testimony from the last British resident still held in the camp.Shaker Aamer claims that the US authorities are systematically making the regime more hardline to try to defuse the strike, which now involves almost two-thirds of the detainees. Techniques include making cells \"freezing cold\" to accentuate the discomfort of those on hunger strike and the introduction of \"metal-tipped\" feeding tubes, which Aamer said were forced into inmates' stomachs twice a day and caused detainees to vomit over themselves.The 46-year-old from London tells of one detainee who was admitted to hospital 10 days ago after a nurse had pushed the tube into his lungs rather than his stomach, causing him later to cough up blood. Aamer also alleges that some nurses at Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo Bay are refusing to wear their name tags in order to prevent detainees registering abuse complaints against staff.Speaking last week from the camp in Cuba, exactly four months after he joined the hunger strike, Aamer said: \"The administration is getting ever more angry and doing everything they can to break our hunger strike. Honestly, I wish I was dead.\"The momentum behind efforts to release Aamer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who has spent more than 11 years without trial inside the camp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mounted sharply last week with David Cameron raising the issue directly with the US president, Barack Obama, during the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.On Wednesday, in a response to a parliamentary question about what had been discussed by the two leaders, Cameron revealed that his next step would be to write to Obama about the \"specifics of the case and everything that we can do to expedite it\". He added: \"Clearly, President Obama wants to make progress on this issue and we should help him in every way that we can with respect to this individual.\"The prime minister's comments are the most positive indication to date that Aamer will eventually be freed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he has been cleared for release twice since 2007.Clive Stafford Smith, the director of the legal charity Reprieve, who passed a transcript of his conversation with Aamer to the Observer, said: \"These gruesome new details show just how bad things are in Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo. The whole thing is at breaking point. Clearly the US military is under enormous pressure and doing everything it can to hurt the men and break the hunger strike.\"Although the military initially denied that there was a hunger strike inside Guantan\u00c3\u00a1mo, it now concedes that, of the 166 detainees, 104 are on hunger strike and 44 are being force-fed.Aamer also documents his declining health and how the camp's regime deliberately inflates the weight of detainees on hunger strike. Aamer, who has permission to live in the UK indefinitely because his wife is a British national, said: \"They said I was 160lb, but I was 154lb a few days ago. Unless there has been a miracle, my weight has not gone up without eating. But they cheat by adding shackles and sometimes even pressing down as they do it to add to your weight.\"If you have a medical standard for when a detainee should be force-fed for his own health, then force-feed him when it can still save his health. Don't wait until his body is so harmed by the lack of food that all you are protecting is the US military \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from the harm of a prisoner dying for a principle.\"Aamer describes his daily diet at Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo as a cup of tea or two each day with a low-calorie sweetener and occasionally an Ocean Spray powder mix that has 10 calories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 enough to give an energy boost.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Shaker Aamer, last British resident held in camp, tells of harsh regime to break strikers' resistance", "article:author":

Despicable Me 2? How much time do you spend with your co-stars Steve Carell, Russell Brand and Steve Coogan?None. None with any of the other actors ever. That's just how it's  done. It's bizarre. I don't know if  it's a timing thing or scheduling or if the animators are working on a specific character one at a time; I honestly don't even know. But sometimes you'll go in for four  hours, and then two months later you'll go in again for half an hour and a month later you will go in for seven hours. It was almost two years of recording in a studio by yourself. It's very random, but it's really fun, because it's very freeing and you can do a million different takes. And you don't have to worry about hair and makeup.In the film, you voice a new character, Lucy Wilde, who Steve Carell's Gru falls in love with. You're saying that all that chemistry was created in the editing room?I know. I'm almost ashamed to admit that we weren't in the same room because people just think that we're doing these scenes together and we're not. Ever. Not one time. In real life I think I ran into him, but not on the film.The trailer for Anchorman: The Legend Continues was released this week and you definitely appear to be in the same room with Steve Carell in that. It seems like your two characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Find each other.What else can you say about the  movie?I can say that we find each other and it's a good thing. And that's about all I can say about it. They are really not giving too many secrets away about the movie. They want it to be a surprise thing.What did you think of the script?I said yes before I even read it, to be honest. I was such a fan of the first one, so I really would have done anything in the movie, walked around in the background. It wasn't even like work; it was really fun.We haven't seen that much of you in films since Bridesmaids, which of course you co-wrote [with her friend Annie Mumolo] as well as starred in. Were you prepared for the success it had?Noooo! You can never predict that stuff. That was our first thing and I knew that we had a great time making it. I also knew that a lot of people know Paul Feig as a director and of course [producer] Judd Apatow, so people were going to see it and I was terrified. It was the first film I've starred in, so it was more nerves than anything. Yeah, we were shocked.You've said that while Bridesmaids  was not autobiographical you share  quite a few similarities with your character. What do you think people responded to?I don't know, I can't answer that. I have people say a lot of different things: sometimes it's the humour or the friendship or feeling like they are losing their best friend because she's getting married or the mother-daughter relationship. The movie is all of those things to me. We just wrote a movie that made us laugh and we wanted to have a lot of female characters in it.You have already ruled out making a sequel to Bridesmaids \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has it been daunting starting a new screenplay?Of course you feel pressure and what I'm working on is very different from Bridesmaids. I don't know what people will expect, but I want to be able to do different things in different genres. I hope people will be open to that.We should expect a new direction then?Yeah, for sure. A lot of actors don't want to do just one thing. People associate you with how they  know you. For me, it's comedy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so when I say I'm doing something dramatic, people are always a little surprised. But to me, it's like, \"I'm an actor, I do a bunch of things.\" I started on Saturday Night Live and most people know me from Bridesmaids, so of course it makes sense that they would see me as somebody who just does comedies but I hope that I get the opportunity to do everything.Your next film, Girl Most Likely, seems to fit that description. It's about a failed playwright who has to move back home with her mother, played by Annette Bening\u00e2\u0080\u00a6It's a darker comedy. I can never find the right word, because you don't want to say \"dramedy\", just because combining words never works. Annette Bening is obviously and not surprisingly amazing in the movie. She's the best. It's probably one of the highlights of my career working with her.You left Saturday Night Live in 2012  after seven years. Has it been hard to let go? I miss the creative aspect of it: you are constantly writing, constantly  on your toes. It's like your brain is in the best shape ever \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then when you leave, you feel a little like your mind is slowly dulling, because you're not having to fix things and solve puzzles and create on a minute-to-minute basis. But it's long hours and it's all-encompassing. Having been gone now for a while, I do have more time, I'm getting a little more sleep and I see daylight more for sure!So you're taking it easy now?I wish I had more free time. I always feel like such an asshole when I say I don't have any free time but it's been a little bit of a crazy year, it's been unusually busy.One of your projects was the new series of Arrested Development, in which you play the young Lucille Bluth. Was that difficult to turn down?Oh yeah, it's one of the best shows on TV. But it's nerve-racking when you're going into a show that you've been a fan of. It was like showing up on the set of Anchorman: you think, \"I know all these characters, I'm coming into their world.\" You have to do a good job.Despicable Me 2 is out on 28 June;  Girl Most Likely on 26 July\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "The Bridesmaids actress tells Tim Lewis about her unseen cartoon co-stars, finding her dark side, and the benefits of leaving Saturday Night

privacy", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/23/nsa-intelligence-industrial-complex-abuse", "text": "\n\t    Let's be absolutely clear about the news that the NSA collects massive amounts of information on US citizens \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from emails, to telephone calls, to videos, under the Prism program and other Fisa court orders: this story has nothing to do with Edward Snowden. As interesting as his flight to Hong Kong might be, the pole-dancing girlfriend, and interviews from undisclosed locations, his fate is just a sideshow to the essential issues of national security versus constitutional guarantees of privacy, which his disclosures have surfaced in sharp relief.Snowden will be hunted relentlessly and, when finally found, with glee, brought back to the US in handcuffs and severely punished. (If Private Bradley Manning's obscene conditions while incarcerated are any indication, it won't be pleasant for Snowden either, even while awaiting trial.) Snowden has already been the object of scorn and derision from the Washington establishment and mainstream media, but, once again, the focus is misplaced on the transiently shiny object. The relevant issue should be: what exactly is the US government doing in the people's name to \"keep us safe\" from terrorists?Prism and other NSA data-mining programs might indeed be very effective in hunting and capturing actual terrorists, but we don't have enough information as a society to make that decision. Despite laudable efforts led by Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall to bring this to the public's attention that were continually thwarted by the administration because everything about this program was deemed \"too secret\", Congress could not even exercise its oversight responsibilities. The intelligence community and their friends on the Hill do not have a right to interpret our rights absent such a discussion. The shock and surprise that Snowden exposed these secrets is hard to understand when over 1.4 million Americans hold \"top secret\" security clearances. When that many have access to sensitive information, is it really so difficult to envision a leak?We are now dealing with a vast intelligence-industrial complex that is largely unaccountable to its citizens. This alarming, unchecked growth of the intelligence sector and the increasingly heavy reliance on subcontractors to carry out core intelligence tasks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now estimated to account for approximately 60% of the intelligence budget \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have intensified since the 9/11 attacks and what was, arguably, our regrettable over-reaction to them.The roots of this trend go back at least as far as the Reagan era, when the political right became obsessed with limiting government and denigrating those who worked for the public sector. It began a wave of privatization \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because everything was held to be more \"cost-efficient\" when done by the private sector \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that only deepened with the political polarization following the election of 2000. As it turns out, the promises of cheaper, more efficient services were hollow, but inertia carried the day.Today, the intelligence sector is so immense that no one person can manage, or even comprehend, its reach. When an operation in the field goes south, who would we prefer to try and correct the damage: a government employee whose loyalty belongs to his country (despite a modest salary), or the subcontractor who wants to ensure that his much fatter paycheck keeps coming? Early polls of Americans about their privacy concerns that the government might be collecting metadata from phone calls and emails indicates that there is little alarm; there appears to be, in fact, an acceptance of or resignation to these practices. To date, there is no proof that the government has used this information to pursue and harass US citizens based on their political views. There are no J Edgar Hoover-like \"enemy lists\" \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 yet. But it is not so difficult to envision a scenario where any of us has a link, via a friend of a friend, to someone on the terrorist watchlist. What then? You may have no idea who this person is, but a supercomputer in Fort Meade (or, soon, at the Utah Data Center near Salt Lake City) will have made this connection. And then you could have some explaining to do to an over-zealous prosecutor.On this spying business, officials from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to self-important senators are, in effect, telling Americans not to worry: it's not that big a deal, and \"trust us\" because they're keeping US citizens safe. This position must be turned on its head and opened up to a genuine discussion about the necessary, dynamic tension between security and privacy. As it now stands, these programs are ripe for abuse unless we establish ground rules and barriers between authentic national security interests and potential political chicanery.The irony of former Vice-President Dick Cheney wringing his hands over the release of classified information is hard to watch. Cheney calls Snowden a traitor. Snowden may not be a hero, but the fact is that we owe him a debt of gratitude for finally bringing this question into the public square for the robust discussion it deserves.\n    ", "og:type":

his weekly address\n\t\t\n\tBarack Obama made a fresh push for comprehensive immigration reform on Saturday, calling for the public to back a Senate bill which he claimed will save the country money in the long term.\"Reach out to your senators and representatives. Tell them that the time for excuses is over. It's time to fix our broken immigration system once and for all,\" the president said in his weekly address, on whitehouse.gov.The bipartisan bill aims to improve border security, attract more highly-skilled workers by changing the visa system, crack down on the hiring of undocumented workers and provide a path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.Obama cited a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimated last Tuesday that the bill would decrease federal budget deficits by nearly $200bn between 2014 and 2023 and by an extra $700bn in the following decade.\"According to this independent report, reforming our immigration system would reduce our deficits by almost a trillion dollars over the next two decades. And it will boost our economy by more than 5%, in part because of businesses created, investments made, and technologies invented by immigrants,\" he said.However, the report's figures drew sceptical comments from Republicans. The CBO also estimated that under the bill \"the net annual flow of unauthorised residents would decrease by about 25% relative to what would occur under current law\". That is not a big enough reduction for conservatives seeking much tighter border control as part of the reforms.Obama said: \"The bill isn't perfect. It's a compromise. Nobody is going to get everything they want, not Democrats, not Republicans, not me.\"The bill was given new impetus on Thursday after an amendment was proposed by two Republican senators, to almost double the number of border patrol agents to 40,000, add fencing and increase the use of surveillance technology. There are already twice as many border patrol agents as there were in 2004, but the amendment may prove palatable to conservatives.The Senate could hold its first vote on the plans on Monday.\n    ",

throwing stones at Fifa offices, Confederations Cup placards being ripped down and burned in the midst of mass protests.These are unlikely scenes in a football-mad country and the last thing organisers of the World Cup wanted to see in Brazil before next year's tournament, but for the past week they have become an almost daily occurrence as the country's favourite sport has become the focus of the biggest demonstrations in decades.In a speech broadcast nationally on Friday night the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, said she accepted the need for change but warned that violence would not be tolerated and appealed to protesters not to endanger the World Cup.More than a million people took to the streets on Thursday night in at least 80 cities in a rising wave of protest that has coincided with the Confederations Cup. This Fifa event was supposed to be a dry run for players and organisers before next year's finals, but it is police and protesters who are getting the most practice.The host cities have been the focus of furious demonstrations, prompting local authorities to request security reinforcements from the national government.The rallies, and the violence that has often followed, were not solely prompted by the tournament. The spark last week was a rise in public transport fares. Anger has since been further stirred by police brutality.Longstanding problems such as corruption, dire public services, high prices and low levels of safety are also prominent among the range of grievances.But the mega-event has been the lightning conductor. Many protesters are furious that the government is spending 31bn reals (\u00c2\u00a39bn) to set the stage for a one-time global tournament, while it has failed to address everyday problems closer to home.\"I'm here to fight corruption and the expense of the World Cup,\" said Nelber Bonifcacio, an unemployed teacher who was among the vast crowds in Rio on Thursday.\"I like football, but Brazil has spent all that money on the event when we don't have good public education, healthcare or infrastructure.\"It was all very different in 2007 when Brazil was awarded the tournament. Back then, crowds in Rio erupted with joy and Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Brazilian Football Confederation, was hailed as he said: \"We are a civilised nation, a nation that is going through an excellent phase, and we have got everything prepared to receive adequately the honour to organise an excellent World Cup.\"In the outside world, few doubted the wisdom of the decision. Football belonged in Brazil. In the home of carnival and samba, it would be a party like no other.But euphoria has steadily faded as preparations for 2014 have drawn attention to the persistent ills of corruption, cronyism, inequality and public insecurity. Those who appeared to have the Midas touch in 2007 now seem cursed.Teixeira was forced to resign last year amid accusations of bribery. Former president Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva has been tainted by revelations of massive vote-buying by the ruling Workers party. Fifa too is mired in a series of corruption scandals that have led to the resignations of several senior executives.The renovation and construction of most of the 12 World Cup stadiums has been late and over budget. Several have been pilloried as white elephants because they are being built in cities with minor teams. The new \u00c2\u00a3325m Man\u00c3\u00a9 Garrincha stadium in Bras\u00c3\u00adlia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which hosted the opening game of the Confederations Cup \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has a capacity of 70,000, but the capital's teams rarely attract more than a few hundred fans.Similarly, the lower-division sides in Cuiab\u00c3\u00a1 and Manaus will struggle to fill a fraction of their 40,000 plus-seater stadiums.The government downplays such concerns, saying the stadiums promote development and have been built for multi-purpose use so they do not have to rely on football for revenue.But suspicions that the construction companies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a main source of kickbacks for politicians \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will be the main beneficiaries of the tournament have grown, particularly in Rio, where the Maracan\u00c3\u00a3 stadium has been refurbished for the second time in a decade at a cost of more than 1bn reals (\u00c2\u00a3295m). It was rebuilt with public money, but the concession to run it has been offered to a private firm, covering barely a fifth of the costs.Meanwhile, Fifa has announced record revenues from broadcasting rights and corporate sponsorship for 2014 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 none of which will go to Brazil's public coffers. With negative headlines also related to evictions and poor engineering quality, the growing public unease alarmed many in the sport even before the protests began.Former national team players Rom\u00c3\u00a1rio, Tost\u00c3\u00a3o and Zico have been warning for many months that something is amiss.\"The population of Brazil seems distant from the World Cup because of what people see as corruption and the overspend on the stadiums and the lack of transparency,\" Zico told the Guardian.With public fury now on full display, football's leading lights also seem divided about how to respond. The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, and Pel\u00c3\u00a9 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the superstar turned MasterCard ambassador \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have drawn derision by calling on protesters to decouple the Confederations Cup and the demonstrations. Ronaldo has been lambasted for remarking: \"A World Cup isn't made with hospitals, my friend. It's made with stadiums.\"Bruno Danna, a shop employee who joined the protests on Thursday, said: \"I'm not against football. I will cheer the national team. But I'm mad at Ronaldo and Pel\u00c3\u00a9.\" The current national team, in contrast, have been vocal in their support for the demonstrations. \"I want a Brazil that is fair and safe and healthier and more honest!\" wrote Neymar on his Instagram blog. The Chelsea defender David Luiz and the midfielder Hulk have also expressed solidarity with those on the street. What happens next is hard to predict.The government has backed down on the bus fare increase, but it will be harder to meet the protesters' demands about the World Cup. The funds are mostly spent and the stadiums cannot be unbuilt.The next potential flashpoints are the Brazil v Italy game in Salvador, and Japan v Mexico in Belo Horizonte before more planned marches on Saturday, as well as the final on 30 June.Fifa has denied speculation that it will call off the Confederations Cup, and the authorities have beefed up security. But the tense situation is hurting the chances of a successful event next year.In a country where football is almost the national religion, people want to enjoy the World Cup, but for millions Fifa has become a tainted brand, associated with a distant global elite who profit at the expense of local people.As one banner, held aloft by a football-loving protester \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Leandro Ferreir \u00e2\u0080\u0093 said on Thursday: \"We don't want a country that is beautiful only for gringos.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Football becomes focus of furious outcry against

Here are the results \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0a fairly eclectic top ten, with some leftfield choices alongside the blockbusters you'd expect to see do well in a public vote. We've included some supporting statements from our esteemed voters, along with links to our reviews of the films. Disagree with the results? Perturbed by the absence of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters? Let us know in the thread below.10. Man of Steel    \n                \n\"Finally showed what fighting with superpowers could be like. Also a more adult take on superheroes\" Chris Dor\u00c3\u00a9\"I thought matching the Richard Donner film was an impossible task but I was wrong.\" Kevin O'ConnorRead the Guardian review9. Spring Breakers    \n                \n\"A bold, visually dazzling, provocative, hilarious and moving film that confirms Harmony Korine as the most important filmmaker of his generation.\" Daniel Hickin\"A topography of young people's minds, a secret treasure map revealing hidden desires and mutated G-Spots of the 21st century.\" Johannes LehnenRead the Guardian review8. Iron Man 3    \n                \n \"Hilarious, clever, non-stop entertainment that had me grinning throughout.\" Louise Crane\"Its dark, funny and clever. My kids love Iron Man and its strikes a perfect balance for a superhero film.\" Paul HealyRead the Guardian review7. Behind the Candelabra    \n                \n\"Michael Douglas is superb \u00e2\u0080\u0093 touching and believable. So glad the British have given it the credit it deserves by screening  the film in cinemas, unlike the American film industry.\" Izzie B\"Quite simply, it's everything you want in a good film. It looks stunning, has top-notch performances all round, contains real laugh out loud moments as well as being really quite unexpectedly moving. Plus add on top of that sequins, Matt Damon in a speedo and Rob Lowe's face and you have not just a good film, but a great one.\" CaitlinRead the Guardian review6. Stoker    \n                \n\"One of the most beautiful films of the year and in fact one of the most beautiful of Park Chan-Wook's career. Matthew Goode's subtly macabre turn had me leave the cinema with a nasty taste in my mouth that I am yet to get rid of and don't think I will lose for the rest of the year. It's sublime film making.\" Saul Allerton\"Definitely a film for multiple viewings, the banality of evil sprinkled with angel dust, that's entertainment.\" Stephen LucasRead the Guardian review5. Mud    \n                \n\"It's Shane meets Stand by Me.\" John Fitzgerald\"It's Americana, coming of age, loss of innocence all rolled into one. Great performances throughout including the continuing revival of McConaughey's career.  It confirms Jeff Nichols as the director to watch.\" Carl Albanese\"It's beguiling, beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, moving, deeply human, and full of exquisite cinematic moments.\" RupertRead the Guardian review4. Star Trek Into Darkness    \n                \n\"A wonderful summer blockbuster with action, suspense, and heart. This year's Avengers.\" Sam Jones\"As a something of an art house cinema lover, I was completely surprised and blown away by this audio visual extravaganza. I had been very sceptical of all this 3D business but couldn't have enjoyed this more. A rip roaring thrill ride that made me completely forget about real life for a couple of hours. Precisely what good entertainment should do.\" Allan Bain\"What a delight to see a Hollywood movie present judicial process \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rather than rampaging revenge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as the correct measure to take against a homeland attack.\" Will StrangeRead the Guardian review3. The Great Gatsby    \n                \n\"A fresh and original take on a classic that has never translated particularly well to the big screen. An unexpected triumph, with superb performances and a soundtrack that is mostly thrilling.\" Stephen Lawlor\"This is a great film. At long last, Luhrmann has achieved his magnum opus.\" Michael Carmichael\"Amazingly cinematic. Baz gives the tale a Shakespearian heft and universality instead of falling into the trap of making a costume drama.\" William MalcomsonRead the Guardian review2. The Place Beyond The Pines    \n                \n\"Innovative, thorough, painful, Shakespearean, great performances.\" Ricardo Vargas\"When a film surprises you, grabs you whole, entices you, and moves you this much, it must be exceptional. You even love its faults. Lovely!\" Hannu Bj\u00c3\u00b6rkbacka\"An epic drama with wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper and of course the man himself Ryan Gosling. Great father son relationship study.\" akbarRead the Guardian review1. Django Unchained    \n                \n\"Tarantino's most complete film since Pulp Fiction, it rises above mere homage to become a classic Western in its own right. Samuel L. Jackson, Leonardo Di Caprio and Jamire Foxx have never been better, and Christoph Waltz is even better than them.\" Doug Scott\"Excellent acting, fantastic soundtrack, perfect direction, engrossing adventure. Totally mesmerized from start to finish.\" Matthew Atherton\"Disturbing, terrifying, hilarious, uncompromising.\" Gemma O'Donnell\"Far and away the best movie of 2013. From soundtrack to cinematography to the outstanding performances of the actors to Quenten's unique blend of ultra violence and op\u00c3\u00a9ra bouffe, Django is an exploding horse head of film magic, fabulous music and just deserts, destined to be a classic.\" Sean MalloyRead the Guardian review\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "We may only be half way through, but 2013 is shaping up to be a great year for films.

Iran", "description": "His surprise election as president has raised hopes at home and abroad, but he will have to move cautiously to avoid alarming hardliners", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/20/hassan-rouhani-iran-president-profile", "text": "\n\t     It was a smart move by the campaign team of Hassan Rouhani to choose a key as the symbol of the politician's endeavour to become Iran's president \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a gift to cartoonists in the wake of a remarkable victory that has created rare optimism at home and abroad about the future of the Islamic republic.In one recent image a smiling Rouhani was portrayed in his mullah's robes and turban, holding out an old-fashioned key to a door with an unmistakably digital lock. It was a witty way of suggesting that for all the excitement, solving Iran's problems could be beyond him.Rouhani, 64, is most often described as a moderate rather than reformist leader. But he is also a senior cleric with impeccable revolutionary credentials who has been an adviser to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and held highly sensitive posts in parliament and the regime.Intriguingly, he served for two years as chief negotiator on the vexed issue of Iran's nuclear programme, at the heart of the country's tense confrontation with the west and the source of the sanctions that are crippling its economy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and was defrocked in 2005 for being too accommodating.In his first comments after winning last Friday's election, he projected calm and conciliation, pledging to \"follow the path of moderation and justice, not extremism\". After the turbulence of the Ahmadinejad era, sighs of relief were audible, from Tehran to Washington.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tHassan Rouhani at his first press conference as president-elect. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\t\t\t\n            \n\"I am trying to maintain a degree of healthy scepticism in the face of Rouhani's massive charm offensive, which is infectious and so needed after the bitter miseries of the last four years,\" said one middle-class Iranian woman.Many speak of his caution and attention to detail. \"Rouhani is smart and moderate with a strategic outlook and thinks very carefully before making up his mind,\" said Hossein Mousavian, a former colleague. \"He would spend days or weeks writing a sentence or making a decision.\"Rouhani has long been close to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the powerful former president who was disqualified from running again this year. Still, the surprise winner has a reputation for avoiding the factions that plague Iran's hybrid system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an Islamic republic based on theocratic authority but with a vigorous parliament and regular elections.\"Rouhani's approach to governing is much closer to Rafsanjani's than anyone else,\" said an old friend. \"He's known as the second Hashemi.\"Early on in the campaign experts suggested Rouhani was not well enough known to win. But in the end he attracted support not only in Tehran but also in provincial towns where Ahmadinejad performed well in the disputed 2009 race.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tRouhani supporters in Tehran. Photograph: Hanif Shoaei/Demotix/Corbis\n\t\t\t\n            \nBorn in 1948, in Sorkhe, a small town in Semnan province, Rouhani was the oldest of five children in what he called a \"religious and revolutionary\" family who lived in a modest home surrounded by vines and pomegranates. His father owned a grocery. His mother, Sakineh, remembers him as a calm boy who excelled at school, read the Qur'an and enjoyed swimming and climbing.He was educated in Qom, the Canterbury of the Shia Muslim world, and changed his family name \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which originally was Feridoun \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as a security measure to avoid the attention of the Savak secret police when preaching against the shah. (Rouhani means cleric in Persian).Unusually for a cleric before the revolution, he studied law at Tehran University. In the 1990s he was awarded a PhD by Glasgow Caledonian University for a thesis on the flexibility of sharia law with reference to the Iranian experience.Little is known of his private life. His wife's name is not public knowledge. The couple had five children, one of whom, a son, was killed in mysterious circumstances.Rouhani spent time in Paris with the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini and Rafsanjani and entered parliament after the revolution. During the war with Iraq in the 1980s he commanded national air defence. In 1986, as deputy speaker in parliament, he took part in secret talks with US officials as part of what became known as the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair.In 1989, the year Khomeini died and Rafsanjani became president, he was appointed secretary of the supreme national security council.\"He is the ultimate insider,\" said a former Tehran-based diplomat. \"He knows all Iran's secrets.\"Rouhani acquired a reputation for staying cool in a crisis. When Iranian diplomats were murdered in Afghanistan in 1998, on the watch of the reformist president Mohammad Khatami, his was one of the rare voices in the regime to oppose a military response, despite public anger.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tRouhani with Jack Straw in Geneva in 2005. Photograph: Martial Trezzini/AP\n\t\t\t\n            \nIn 2003, with the region in turmoil after the US invasion of Iraq, he became Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, agreeing voluntarily in talks with the EU3 (Britain, France and Germany) to suspend uranium enrichment temporarily.Jack Straw, who was then UK foreign secretary, remembered him as \"warm and engaging \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a strong Iranian patriot [who] was tough but fair to deal with and always on top of his brief\".He was a man with whom westerners felt they could do business.An EU official recalled: \"Rouhani was different from Ahmadinejad, who was a kind of loony populist who would have sold his grandmother to do a deal, though the supreme leader wouldn't let him. Nor was he like [his successor as nuclear negotiator] Ali Larijani, who was a sophisticated fellow traveller of the revolution. Rouhani struck me as a kind of serious moderate who was methodical, thoughtful and conservative.\"Rouhani did not share the visceral anti-Americanism of the Iranian revolutionary tradition. In 2003 he attracted attention by visiting the scene of the Bam earthquake and thanking the US for its help. In 2005, after resigning his nuclear post when Ahmadinejad took power, he ran the centre for strategic research (CSR), a government thinktank that became a refuge for many sidelined by the abrasive president.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tRouhani with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nLater, according to a classified US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks, the CSR was asked to help the campaign of Mir Hossein Mousavi, the Green leader who claimed that his victory, four years ago, had been stolen by Ahmadinejad. But Rouhani failed to speak out publicly against the brutal suppression of the protests that followed.During this year's election campaign he was keen to display a moderate position on foreign affairs, citing Iran's \"active impartiality\" during the 1991 Gulf war, a security pact with Saudi Arabia in the Khatami period, and Iran's \"reasonable position\" in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US.\"Rouhani will return many seasoned technocrats and diplomats to key positions and reinstate a sense of professionalism to the government,\" said Bijan Khajehpour, editor of Iran Strategic Focus.But excitement about his victory is tempered by the knowledge that he will need to move cautiously to avoid alarming conservatives and hardliners, including Khamenei and the powerful Revolutionary Guards. Khatami has already warned Rouhani's supporters not to expect him to deliver too much too soon.Ali Ansari, of St Andrews University, said: \"Whatever people are now saying about him, Rouhani is no Khatami, and faces a degraded state structure populated by a rightwing establishment with a sense of entitlement from years of easy oil money.\"The task ahead of him is enormous and will in many ways be dictated by the strength of elite dissatisfaction, the maintenance of popular support, and last but by no means least the willingness of the leader to effectively take a back seat and give him space.\"It is clear that with the stakes so high, for Iran and for the world, this careful and experienced politician will be closely watched when he takes office in August. His first big test, many suggest, will be whether he can make good his pledge that Mousavi and another reformist, Mehdi Karroubi, be released from house arrest.\"It will take Rouhani some time to get his footing and work with the supreme leader, who can't be too eager,\" said a former senior US administration official. \"But Rouhani is a pretty tough character, and moderate is a relative term in the Iranian political system. If he tries to reform he may find out, like Gorbachev did, that an authoritarian system is not reformable because it risks unleashing forces that may eventually bring it down. I sense that Khamenei knows that and will try to limit reforms. It will depend on how much repressed energy has built up and whether half measures will be too little too late.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "His surprise election as president

first serious discussions with the new manager this week.Moyes left for his summer break intending to keep the striker at Old Trafford so there is hope on both sides that Rooney's future can be settled and talks can then move on to a fresh deal.Only two years remain on Rooney's current \u00c2\u00a3300,000-a-week contract and if fresh terms can be agreed they will be on a more incentivised basis, in line with a widespread move in the domestic game.Rooney's desire is to remain at United because he recognises a transfer at this point of his career to any other English club represents a step down. He has no wish to uproot his young family, following last month's birth of his second son, Klay, and with his wife, Coleen, settled in the north-west, a move abroad is not his preferred option.Rooney and Moyes have not yet been able to meet because the forward's former manager at Everton does not officially succeed Sir Alex Ferguon until 1 July and both have been on holiday.They return this week and Rooney will begin talks with his priority to indicate to Moyes that despite difficulties under Ferguson last season, he wishes to remain at United.With incentives, Rooney's current deal makes him the Premier League's highest paid footballer with earnings of about \u00c2\u00a3300,000 a week. Of this the basic salary is close to the \u00c2\u00a3250,000 mark. But following the trend of other Premier League clubs, United will not wish to offer such a high base-level again to the player who agitated for a move to rivals Manchester City in October 2010, only to be persuaded by Ferguson to stay.As with Yaya Tour\u00c3\u00a9's recently signed contract at Manchester City, any new deal will be more heavily incentivised, raising the prospect that Rooney could again earn close to his current level of pay.Although United maintain Rooney is not for sale, if negotiations between the two sides did break down the best course for both player and club might be for him to leave. The difficulty, though, lies in the limited number of suitors who could match United's \u00c2\u00a335m valuation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though they may have to accept closer to \u00c2\u00a325m \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Rooney's wage demands.Chelsea are thought to retain an interest in him and their head coach, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Mourinho, recently said: \"Rooney is at a fantastic age. He has maturity, big experience and he's still young. It's up to him what he wants, what makes him happy.\"Arsenal have also indicated that they could now afford a player of Rooney's status, with Ivan Gazidis, the chief executive, making the claim at the start of the month. Last season representatives of Paris Saint-Germain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a club which, like City, is backed by oil-rich owners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 also revealed their admiration for him.Rooney's future is in the balance after an uneven season for United in which Ferguson repeatedly played him out of position and dropped him for the campaign's biggest match, the Champions League last-16 second leg against Real Madrid at Old Trafford in March.Last month Rooney met Ferguson to discuss his prospects at United, and the forward requested to leave in the summer if he could not be guaranteed a regular starting place. Yet the meeting occurred before Ferguson announced his retirement, and the dynamic has changed markedly following Moyes's arrival.Rooney played under Moyes when he made his professional debut at Everton in 2002 and despite relations breaking down after the Scot sued the forward for comments written in his autobiography there are no unresolved issues between them.Three years ago Rooney telephoned Moyes to apologise for his comments, a decision the 50-year-old manager has since publicly praised.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Wayne Rooney will tell his manager David

of southern Alberta, leading authorities to evacuate the city of Calgary's entire downtown.The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, called the level of flooding \"stunning\" and said officials don't know yet if it will get worse. Harper also said the water had peaked and stabilized and noted that the weather has improved.Overflowing rivers washed out roads and bridges, soaked homes and turned streets into dirt-brown waterways around southern Alberta. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police sergeant, Patricia Neely, said two bodies had been recovered and a third was in an area that made it too dangerous to recover.As the sun rose in Calgary on Saturday morning, it wasn't raining and some of the 75,000 flood evacuees were holding out hope they might soon be allowed back into their homes. However, Mayor Naheed Nenshi said earlier the downtown area was still without power and remained off-limits. \"It is extremely unlikely that people will be able to return to those buildings before the middle of next week,\" he said.Nenshi also warned there could be another wave of danger ahead. \"There is a scenario in which upstream events at the dams further upstream from the city will lead to another surge in the Bow River,\" he said. \"We don't know how realistic that scenario is, but we will have some hours warning if that actually happens.\"The flood has hit some of the city's iconic structures hard. The Saddledome, home to the NHL's Calgary Flames, was flooded up to the 10th row of seats. That would mean the dressing rooms are submerged as well.Harper, a Calgary resident, said he never imagined there would be a flood of this magnitude in this part of Canada. \"This is incredible. I've seen a little bit of flooding in Calgary before. I don't think any of us have seen anything like this before. The magnitude is just extraordinary,\" he said.\"We're all very concerned that if gets much more than this it could have real impact on infrastructure and other services longer term, so we're hoping things will subside a bit.\"Twenty-five neighborhoods in the city, with an estimated 75,000 residents, were evacuated. About 1,500 have gone to emergency shelters while the rest have found shelter with family or friends, Nenshi said. About 350,000 people work in downtown Calgary on a typical day. However, officials said very few people need to be moved out, since many heeded warnings and did not go to work on Friday.The Alberta premier, Alison Redford, said Medicine Hat, downstream from Calgary, was under a mandatory evacuation order affecting 10,000 residents. Redford warned that communities downstream of Calgary had not yet felt the full force of the floodwater.A spokesman for Canada's defense minister said 1,300 soldiers from a base in Edmonton were being deployed to the flood zone. Police were asking residents who were forced to leave the nearby High River area to register at evacuation shelter. The Town of High River remained under a mandatory evacuation order.The flood was forcing emergency plans at the Calgary Zoo, which is situated on an island near where the Elbow and Bow rivers meet. Lions and tigers were being prepared for transfer, if necessary, to prisoner holding cells at the courthouse.It had been a rainy week throughout much of Alberta, but on Thursday the Bow River Basin was battered with up to four inches of rain.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper says magnitude of flooding in southern Alberta 'is just

decision to pull out of the French \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was always going to be a tough challenge for him, especially if he's not 100% fit and healthy. Having that extra time to get everything right has been very valuable. I hit with him recently and he seemed like he's in good shape. When you reflect on what happened 12 months ago, he was so close to winning Wimbledon for the first time and that match was massively disappointing. But then winning Olympic gold on the same court against the same player was a huge moment in his career. On top of that to get his first grand slam title, to get that monkey off his back away from Wimbledon gives him the ideal opportunity this year.I'd be completely shocked if the winner doesn't come out of the top four this year. I'd like to back Murray, he looks fresh and eager. Although having said that you can certainly put a very good case for all of them.So, how would you make the case?Rafael Nadal?He hasn't played a warm-up on a few occasions I think but it won't have any bearing on his performance at Wimbledon. What he has achieved on his comeback from injury has been sensational, winning seven out of nine tournaments. To win his eighth French Open was unprecedented and he's won twice here before \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he'll fancy his chances for sure.Novak Djokovic?He's going to be smarting after his semi-final loss [at Roland Garros]. He really talked openly and honestly about how much the French Open would mean to him, winning all four grand slams, so to lose 9-7 in the fifth must have been hugely disappointing. But again he's going to be eager to bounce back. I think it's fair to say that the No1 ranking in the coming months is going to be in jeopardy.Roger Federer?It's not getting any easier for him and I think he was bitterly disappointed about his defeat by [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga [in Paris]. He looked very flat and didn't have the spark that we have come to expect. But on a grass court at Wimbledon I think he's a different kettle of fish because he's still the most attacking player in the game. That really benefits him on a grass court and for his opponents it's not a surface that you can usually defend well on.Who might cause an upset?My big outsider is Tsonga, but he's not exactly an outsider when he is ranked sixth in the world. He's a guy who has the weapons and is starting to show a little bit more consistency. He's beaten Federer here before so definitely him, [Tomas] Berdych and [Juan Mart\u00c3\u00adn] Del Potro \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the top eight are strong. Tsonga still has a little of the French streak in him where he is a bit unpredictable but on his day he's capable of beating anyone and he likes grass courts.Can you see anyone beating Serena Williams in the women's draw?What she's doing right now is amazing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she's playing great, she's probably in the best shape of her career and looks like she's really enjoying herself. That's a very dangerous combination for everybody else because when she's on form and motivated I almost think she's unstoppable. She's definitely the favourite at Wimbledon. But Sharapova will be looking to add to the title she won here nine years ago. It feels as though she has been around forever. She has won all four grand slams and remains a great competitor. She's got a game that really suits grass.How do you think the British players will fare?I think the British girls have a great opportunity. Laura Robson and Heather Watson have both done really well, they've made a lot of improvements and their rankings have also improved. I wouldn't say they are going to win Wimbledon right now but if they can get into the second week anything is possible. Laura definitely has the tools to her game but also has a lot of areas that she can improve on. She's now working with Miles Maclagan and I think that is a good appointment at this moment in time. We're all aware of what a great game she's got, she's a very good ball striker and aggressive from the baseline. She needs to get her second serve to a more consistent level and I think she can get fitter and faster around the court. If she makes those improvements she can be even better. Heather is in a slightly different position, she comes in on the back of having glandular fever but it seems like she's 100% fit and healthy and is such a great athlete, she can have a good run.Tim Henman, who was talking to James Riach, will be commentating throughout Wimbledon for BBC Sport\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Former British No1 runs the rule over Wimbledon men's

several Brazilian cities and engaged police in isolated intense conflicts. Demonstrators vowed to stay in the streets until concrete steps are taken to reform the political system.Across Brazil protesters gathered to denounce legislation known as PEC 37 that would limit the power of federal prosecutors to investigate crimes. Many fear the laws would hinder attempts to jail corrupt politicians.Federal prosecutors were behind the investigation into the biggest corruption case in Brazil's history, the so-called \"mensal\u00c3\u00a3o\" cash-for-votes scheme that came to light in 2005 and involved top aides of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva buying off members of congress to vote for their legislation.Last year the supreme court condemned two dozen people in connection to the case, which was hailed as a watershed moment in Brazil's fight against corruption. However those condemned have yet to be jailed because of appeals, a delay that has enraged Brazilians.The protests continued despite a primetime speech the night before from President Dilma Rousseff, a former leftist guerrilla who was tortured during Brazil's military dictatorship. She tried to appease demonstrators by reiterating that peaceful protests were a welcome, democratic action and emphasising that she would not condone corruption in her government.\t\n\t\t        \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tfunction getOmnitureAccount_(){\n\t\t\treturn \"guardiangu-network\";\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tfunction getOmnitureData_() {\n\n\t\t\tvar omniture = new Object();\n\n\t\t\tomniture.prop43=\"Video\";\n\t\t\tomniture.prop44=\"Brazil protests: \\'we will lose a lot through violence\\', says president -:Video:1926386\";\n\t\t\tomniture.prop45=\"World news\";\n\n\t\t\tomniture.eVar43=\"Video\";\n\t\t\tomniture.eVar44=\"Brazil protests: \\'we will lose a lot through violence\\', says president -:Video:1926386\";\n\t\t\tomniture.eVar45=\"World news\";\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn omniture;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t\n    \n                        \n\n    \n        supports_local_storage = function () {\n            try {\n                return 'localStorage' in window && window.localStorage !== null;\n            } catch (e) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        };\n\n        mediaPreference = function (pref) {\n            if (pref === 'html' && checkGuardianCodecs()) {\n                localStorage.setItem(\"mediaPreference\", pref);\n                return \"You have set your audio/video preference to 'html'.

Nobody can take the corruption of this country any more.\"The wave of protests began as opposition to transportation fare hikes, then became a laundry list of causes including anger at high taxes, poor services and high World Cup spending, before coalescing around the issue of rampant government corruption. They have become the largest public demonstrations that Latin America's biggest nation has seen in two decades.Across Brazil police estimated that about 60,000 demonstrators gathered in a central square in the city of Belo Horizonte, 30,000 shut down a main business avenue in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo and another 30,000 gathered in the city in southern Brazil where a nightclub fire killed over 240 mostly university students, deaths many argued could have been avoided with better government oversight of fire laws. Tens of thousands more protested in more than 100 Brazilian cities, bringing the nationwide total to 250,000, according to a police count published on the website of O Globo TV, Brazil's largest television network.In Belo Horizonte police used teargas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who tried to pass through a barrier and hurled rocks at a car dealership. Salvador also saw protests turn violent.During her pre-recorded TV speech Rousseff promised that she would always battle corruption and that she would meet with peaceful protesters, governors and the mayors of big cities to create a national plan to improve urban transportation and use oil royalties for investments in education.Many Brazilians, shocked by a week of protests and violence, hoped that Rousseff's words after several days of silence from the leader would soothe tensions and help avoid more violence, but not all were convinced by her promises of action. Victoria Villela, a 21-year-old university student in the S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo protest, said she was \"frustrated and exhausted by the endless corruption of our government\".\"It was good Dilma spoke but this movement has moved too far, there was not much she could really say. All my friends were talking on Facebook about how she said nothing that satisfied them. I think the protests are going to continue for a long time and the crowds will still be huge.\"In the north-eastern city of Salvador, where Brazil's national football team played Italy and won 4-2 in a Confederations Cup match, about 5,000 protesters gathered three miles (5km) from the stadium, shouting demands for better schools and transportation and denouncing heavy spending on next year's World Cup.They blocked a main road and clashed with riot police who moved in to clear the street. Protesters said police used rubber bullets and tossed teargas canisters from a helicopter hovering overhead. The protesters scattered and fled to a nearby shopping mall, where they tried to take shelter in an underground parking garage.\"We sat down and the police came and asked us to free up one lane for traffic. As we were organising our group to do just that, the police lost their patience and began to shoot at us and throw [tear gas] canisters,\" said Rodrigo Dorado.That was exactly the type of conflict Rousseff said needed to end, not just so Brazilians could begin a peaceful national discussion about corruption but because much of the violence is taking place in cities hosting foreign tourists attending the Confederations Cup.Brazil's news media, which had blasted Rousseff in recent days for her lack of response to the protests, seemed largely unimpressed with her careful speech but noted the difficult situation facing a government trying to understand a mass movement with no central leaders and a flood of demands. With \"no objective information about the nature of the organisation of the protests\", wrote Igor Gielow in a column for Brazil's biggest newspaper, Folha de S Paulo, \"Dilma resorted to an innocuous speech to cool down spirits\".At the protests' height an estimated million anti-government demonstrators took to the streets nationwide on Thursday night with grievances ranging from public services to the billions of dollars spent preparing for international sports events.Outside the stadium in Belo Horizonte where Mexico and Japan met in a Confederations Cup game, Dadiana Gamaleliel, a 32-year-old physiotherapist, held up a banner that read: \"Not against the games, in favour of the nation.\"\"I am protesting on behalf of the whole nation because this must be a nation where people have a voice \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we don't have a voice any more,\" she said.She said Rousseff's speech would not change anything. \"She spoke in a general way and didn't say what she would do,\" Gamaleliel said. \"We will continue this until we are heard.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Anger as legislation that ties federal prosecutors' hands when investigating crime is

"Andy Murray talks about family, pizza and how Wimbledon finally feels like home to him", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/22/andy-murray-home-comforts-wimbledon", "text": "\n\t    There are two bottles of mineral water, one sparkling, the other still, lined up on the table in front of Andy Murray as we settle down to talk in the excruciatingly posh Hurlingham Club, on the banks of the Thames near Fulham, after his final workout before Wimbledon. A small wager with a colleague on which water Murray will choose is down.He chooses still. I should have known: athletes do not drink fizzy water usually because it interferes with digestion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Murray is as meticulous about these seemingly small details as he is about the placement of a cross-court forehand at match point. Besides, he has brought his own special mixture. Of course he has.If this conveys the impression the Scot is a machine it is misleading. As much as he has honed his body into premium shape through tortuous gym-based sacrifice over several winters, what he has also done since we first saw him at Wimbledon as a raw teenager, with nary a bicep worth the name, is grow as a human being. In a world where professional athletes can struggle with celebrity Murray seems as immune to the burden as anyone who springs to mind.If the cards fall kindly for him in the coming fortnight, starting with his opening match against Benjamin Becker on Monday, he knows that the expectations of a nation will reach an even higher pitch than they did 12 months ago, in two contrasting yet equally significant finals on these lawns: his loss in the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer and his victory over him in the Olympics.Well-founded suspicions that such emotional tidal waves would invariably drown him in the past have faded. He might cry, but he'll get the job done first. He has learned to harness pressure and fear. This keenest of boxing fans knows the line Mike Tyson took from his training sage Cus D'Amato: fire can burn your house down or keep you warm.\"All of the guys I work with,\" Murray says between sips of his private potion, \"before I play a big match there are going to be nerves there. I'm sure even Ivan [Lendl] gets nervous and he has been in those positions as a player and now as a coach. I don't mind that. It shows everyone cares. There will be times, I'm sure, we can look back on and enjoy them when I've finished playing, but it is stressful when you are preparing for a Slam final. It's not easy.\" Nor should it be. Players have a term for coping with it: staying in the moment. \"Nerves affect everyone in different ways,\" he says.\"I've always felt that when I've been nervous my shot selection is pretty good. I don't necessarily feel it in my head, I don't start rushing or panicking or anything like that. I sometimes feel it in my legs.\"So, if the commentators rush to judgment when Murray tugs at his thigh after a poor or missed shot, perhaps we will now realise he is just tinkering with his psychic machine, looking for comfort.He has the benefit in this tournament of living no more than half an hour from his workplace, a gentle drive up from Oxshott in Surrey in the first car he ever owned, a Volkswagen Polo. He is not a limousine man. He will relax at home with his girlfriend, Kim, his mother, Judy, and the dogs: normality before the insanity.\"I always sleep well before big matches, that's not a problem,\" he says. You're just thinking about the playing the match, and you also think about all the work and effort you have put in to get into that position, that you want to go out there and give a good account of yourself, and sometimes that's where nerves come from.\"For solace he retreats to the place anyone with the option would choose: at home with his family. After losing the Wimbledon final Murray went back to Oxshott, closed the door to the world and was comforted by those he trusts the most. \"They knew how upset I was but they don't want to baby you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and you may be feeling quite sensitive. You get on the defensive right away, and they say, 'You did great', or whatever. Tough to explain. But they are very supportive, and they picked me up ... We watched TV, ordered a couple pizzas, and stayed up quite late.\"Pizza: it will do it every time. Or a hug from a schoolboy, the one who ran through the crowd to hug Murray and his Olympic gold medal. \"At the time you don't think too much of it. But people were coming up to me and saying how great that was. The little kid just seemed so happy. His dad didn't know where he'd gone, lost him, he'd snuck up. It was nice.\"\"Nice\" is fine, but what about hostility on court, the X-factor that can mean the difference between winning and losing? Ernests Gulbis suggested in Paris last month that the leading players were lost in a mutual admiration pact of meaningless words. Federer, Mr Nice, surprisingly, would welcome a bit of edge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and there was plenty of it between him and Murray in the semi-final in Melbourne this year, when they snarled across the net at each other in the fourth set. Federer says he can't remember what it was about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but he does remember winning the set.\"It would be interesting,\" Federer said, \"a different take, a different vibe. We do get along very well so it's harder to be rougher on the guys, because, at the end, as we saw in Australia, you win or lose \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and in my case I lost \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then I went to the press and I see Andy and I say, 'All the best, I hope you win the final.' It's not like 'Ooh, I don't want to see you ever again.' Or, like, you just totally avoid the guy.\"They will avoid each other here at least until the semi-finals. And then it will be war again but, as Federer describes it, \"civilised\" conflict. While there is much respect between them, there is a sense that Murray is gaining the upper hand. Federer said it had always been tough playing Murray.\"The last 18 months, two years,\" Murray says, \"I've started to be a bit more aggressive and understand what shots to play at the right times of matches and the sort of tennis I need to play to beat the top players at the big events. Given the situation I had a few weeks ago with the [back] injury I've prepared pretty much as best I could and given myself the best opportunity to do well. I spend a lot of time [at Wimbledon]. I know a lot of the people. I feel comfortable in the surroundings. It feels like a home court to me.\"With that he takes a final sip on his bottle of cloudy water and lopes away like a well-prepared lion for battle at a place he finally can call home.\n    ",

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/20/immigration-deal-border-patrol-agents", "text": "\n\t    Conservative efforts to frustrate immigration reform were rebuffed on Thursday, bringing Congress one step closer to legalising the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the US.As the battle to pass legislation proved far tougher than many expected, a new group of moderate Republican senators proposed doubling the number of border guards to 40,000 in a \"human fence\" to secure the southern border with Mexico.Their border security amendment goes far further than the original \"gang of eight\" Republican and Democrat senators who introduced immigration reform in April but is thought crucial in persuading more conservative Republicans to accept the proposed amnesty for existing immigrants.Although passage of the bill through the Senate is not in doubt due to a Democratic majority, the debate is on a knife edge in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives after speaker John Boehner insisted he would only allow a vote if a majority of his party caucus were in favour.The legislation is seen as a centrepiece of President Obama's second term and a test of whether Congress can function at all in an era of mounting partisan mistrust.But in a crucial day for the bill and a extraordinary day for the future of the Republican party, a succession of party heavyweights stood up to defy the conservative wing and push legislation forward.Senators Bob Corker and John Hoeven joined original Rebublican supporters of the bill such as Marco Rubio, Lindsay Graham and John McCain to make emotive appeals on the floor of the Senate.Rubio called the current immigration system \"a disaster of epic proportions\". \"Shouldn't a nation founded on judeo-christian principles bring these people out of the shadows?\" added McCain.Hoeven and Corker said their plan, including 350 extra miles of physical fencing, would cost $30bn but would be more than paid for out of the $197bn worth of extra economic growth that the congressional budget office estimates would stem from the amnesty over 10 years.\"We are on the verge of a huge breakthrough,\" said Democrat Charles Schumer, who called the 20,000 extra border security guards a \"virtual human fence\". \"There was a group of colleagues who were inclined to vote for the bill but first wanted to see stronger border controls \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that make sense.\"The battle is far from over however. At the same time Republican leaders were calling for immigration reform, a press conference was called by the Tea Party wing in Congress threatening to block even the amended bill when it reaches the House.Senator Jeff Sessions said the bill had been written by \"special interests\", referring to deals struck big business and union groups. \"We need to listen to the people of America, not special interests,\" he said. The Corker/Hoeven amendment has also taken longer to draft than expected and had not yet been published, let alone voted on, by mid-afternoon on Thursday.There are currently 278 other amendments waiting to be debated before a proposed Senate vote on the full bill by July 4. \"Our ability to legislate has gone out of the window,\" said Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu .Senator John Cornyn attempted to get another border security amendment debated that would postpone all amnesty until 90% border security could be guaranteed, but this was shelved with the help of the moderate Republican alliance.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Proposal would double the overall number of US border patrol agents in move thought of as crucial to persuading conservatives",

trekkers at a mountain camp, killing nine tourists and one local guide.Police said 15 men wearing the uniforms of a local security force attacked at 1am, killing five Ukrainians, three Chinese and one Russian as they rested at the base camp of Nanga Parbat, one of the world's highest peaks.Pakistanis supporting the foreign tourists were held at gunpoint while the tourists were robbed and killed. One Chinese tourist managed to escape.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibilty for the massacre, saying it was revenge for US drone strikes.Ehsnaullah Ehsan, spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), told the Express Tribune that the attack was carried out by a previously unheard of Taliban faction called Junud-e-Hafsa.He said it was a revenge for the killing in May of Wali-ur-Rehman, the TTP's second most senior commander.Attacks on foreigners are unheard of in the beautiful mountainous region of Gilgit-Baltistan, which still attracts a trickle of tourists and climbers despite Pakistan's reputation as a hotbed of terrorist violence and instability.Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The government of Pakistan expresses its deep sense of shock and grief on this brutal act of terrorism.\"In an unusual move the interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, immediately sacked Gilgit-Baltistan's police chief and another senior provincial official.Muhammad Ami Rana, director of the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, said he suspected Junud-e-Hafsa probably did not exist as a real group, but was simply a name given to local militants for the purpose of the operation.He said the attack could suggest the TTP was forming alliances with local groups normally motivated by a sectarian agenda.\"This appears to have been a well-planned terrorist attack and indicates militants have developed their network in the area,\" he said. \"The TTP, al-Qaida and other foreign terrorist groups are basically tapping into the sectarian tendencies that are already there.\"The killing of Chinese tourists will be of particular concern for Pakistan, which cherishes its strong strategic relationship with China as a vital balance to US influence in the region. Only last month the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, visited Pakistan as part of regional tour.Opinion polls show that China is the country Pakistanis regard most highly. But Pakistan is the most dangerous place in the world for Chinese citizens.In recent years in Gilgit-Baltistan, Sunni terrorist groups have massacred civilians from the rival Shia sect, whom they regard as heretics.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Five Ukrainians, three Chinese and one Russian along with a local guide killed at mountain base camp in Gilgit-Baltistan",

Murray weightier than ever at Wimbledon this year.As the gates to the All England Club open on Monday for the nerve-jangling fortnight, Murray will walk through them as a reigning British male grand slam champion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the first to do so since Fred Perry completed his Wimbledon hat-trick in 1936.The 26-year-old Scot, seeded No 2, tasted Centre Court glory when he won Olympic gold at the London Games last August, and five weeks later he beat Novak Djokovic in the US Open final.\"There's a lot more pressure, a lot more expectation and a lot more nerves,\" Murray said at the weekend. \"But there is still the excitement too.\"The British No 1 has been drawn against Germany's Benjamin Becker in the first round. Murray beat Becker in their only previous meeting at Queen's earlier this month, on his way to securing that title. A relatively kind draw means Murray will avoid a quarter-final meeting with Rafael Nadal, the No 5 seed, but could meet him in the semis.Murray's nail-biting progress through the rounds has become a major part of the annual tennis-fest in SW19, which this year sees significantly increased prize money on offer. Players who reach the first round will each receive \u00c2\u00a323,500, up \u00c2\u00a39,000 on last year and keeping pace with the competitive world of grand slams. The increase will benefit lower-ranked players who have long complained about grand slam prize money distribution only going in one direction, and who find it difficult to fund the pursuit of their dreams.With a prize money pot of \u00c2\u00a322.56m available \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an overall increase of 40% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the men's and women's singles champions will each walk away with \u00c2\u00a31.6m, up \u00c2\u00a3450,000 on last year.Also likely to be up this year is Centre Court's retractable roof, with the weather forecast looking unsettled (though tennis fans have to wait until 2019 for court one to be similarly equipped). After an overcast start, some showers and some sunshine are predicted in a mainly pleasant first week. Those in \"the queue\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which traditionally sees thousand camping or arriving pre-dawn for on-the-day tickets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are unlikely to see temperatures match 26 June 1976, the hottest day ever at Wimbledon when temperatures soared to 34.6C, or to need to prepare for the almost constant deluge that was 1991, when 69.8mm of rain fell during the tournament. Despite the jokes, just 32 days have been completely rained off in the championship's 135 years.Wimbledon's famed strawberries, at \u00c2\u00a32.50 a punnet, cost the same as last year, with visitors expected to get through a total of 8,615 punnets a day. Growers report the fruit is 40% sweeter and 15% larger than normal.Marion Regan, whose Hugh Lowe Farms near Maidstone, Kent, supply the championship's official caterer, said: \"With the coldest spring for 50 years, the strawberries flowered later than usual, but this means the crop will peak in late June/early July. Because it has had plenty of time to develop, we are seeing some of the finest fruit for a long time.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "No 2 seed is the first Briton to begin the

made his name playing the laidback stoner. Now Seth Rogen has written, directed and produced a send-up of his own super-successful comedy crew. Is it all a happy accident \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or is he the\u00a0most\u2026", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/jun/22/seth-rogen-slackers-guide-getting-ahead", "text": "\n\t    Seth Rogen is so exactly like his onscreen self that hanging out with him can feel a little like dropping into one of his movies. \"Have just been advised Seth only needs 10 mins for grooming,\" reads one of the emails that shuttle between his publicists and the Guardian's photographer, which sounds about right. The roly-poly figure who turns up a few minutes later in jeans and T-shirt, topped off with jewfro and froggy grin, seems barely to need 10 minutes for anything. \"Hey, what's going on?\" he says, before settling into a sofa that looks custom-moulded to his contours. He talks in sentences that go up, up, up, up, up like a rollercoaster car, his furry eyebrows shooting up for emphasis, before beginning their long descent, down, down, down, down towards the point, or the punchline, which is invariably marked by that gurgling, Mutleyesque laugh of his: \"Hurhurhurhurhurhur.\"\"I think I had my midlife crisis when I was 10,\" he says. \"I was an angsty kid. I didn't know what I\u00a0wanted to do. I remember being very disillusioned with life and I didn't like school.\" As\u00a0soon as he realised you could be funny as a job, that was the job he wanted to do. Since then, his movies have grossed just shy of a billion dollars. Rogen is the most successful comic leading man of his generation, whether playing producer-director Judd Apatow's alter ego in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up or, with his writing partner Evan Goldberg, providing America's so-called \"comedy mafia\" with some of their biggest hits, including Superbad and Pineapple Express. This week he goes one better with his new movie This Is The End, which he co-wrote, co-produced, co-directed and stars in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thus beating to the punch Ryan Gosling, Matt Damon and every other pretty boy who aspires to direct.\"Someone had to, hurhurhur,\" he chortles, before adding, \"The 50 days we spent making the movie were as much fun, probably more fun, than people probably imagine.\" The film features Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Danny McBride and Jonah Hill, all playing themselves, holed up at\u00a0Franco's house, getting high on weed when the apocalypse hits. It's the ultimate stoner freakout movie-cum-group-comedy roast, with each star sending up aspects of his persona. Baruchel is the not-quite-famous friend who complains jealously that Rogen has dropped him for his new Hollywood chums. Franco is the art-hoarding pseud whose basement is filled with memorabilia from his own films. Hill is the slick, Oscar-nominated Pollyanna who is later sodomised by the devil. McBride is the prick who eats everybody's food.The studio, Sony, took some persuading of the basic idea. \"The violence they were OK with, the sexual stuff. Never a note about demon dick,\" Rogen says. \"It was all about us playing ourselves. They were afraid it would feel like an extended MTV movie award skit, or a Funny Or Die skit, and that it would just add a disingenuous texture to it. They were like, 'It'll make it less realistic', and we were like, 'It's more realistic. We're us. There's no break in reality between the world that you as the viewer are in and the world that we are in.'\"Interestingly, Rogen's character \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the guilty sellout who's made too many movies and worries about his weight \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was the last to come together. \"In a way, I am the straightest guy in the movie,\" he says. \"I\u00a0play, like, the glue, the common thread between everyone, trying to make everyone happy.\" He seems to have a similar role in real life \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if only because it is his and Goldberg's scripts that so often bring everyone together. \"Lots of us are loners,\" Apatow says. \"At the end of the day, we would rather be by ourselves. Seth likes being around people. He's much less needy than most of the people in the comedy business. He doesn't desperately seek approval. If you see Seth on a\u00a0talkshow, he seems very comfortable. I never see him pacing frantically, worrying whether or not he's going to have a great spot on Letterman. He seems amused by the whole thing. A lot of us, if we\u00a0don't do well, we think we're going to die. It's more like he gets a kick out of it. People definitely want to be around that. He's got his shit together.\"Still, Apatow sometimes teases him: \"I don't get why you're funny. Nothing really bad has ever happened to you.\" In a business populated by midnight prowlers mining bottomless pools of pain for their standup routines, Rogen is exceptional for his benign temperament. Not that his sense of humour isn't athletically obscene; but whether he's riffing about cacking his pants while watching Gladiator, or wondering why people have deodorants for their armpits but not their backsides, he exudes the gurgling contentment of a child. Onscreen, his persona is a\u00a0matter of zero torque. \"He can really go at you hard,\" Apatow says, \"but underneath it, you know he's a good guy. I don't know why I must always look for pain. Even when it is not there.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\t\u00e2\u0080\u0098It was all about us playing ourselves\u00e2\u0080\u0099: Danny McBride, Seth Rogen and James Franco in This Is The End, getting high as the apocalypse hits. Photograph: Allstar/Columbia\n\t\t\t\n            \nNice guys aren't famous for getting ahead in Hollywood, I say to Rogen. \"Oh, I've had to motherfuck a few people every now and then,\" he admits, his laughter acquiring a slight edge of unease. \"It's a relationship-driven city in a lot of ways, and a relationship-driven industry, and if you're perceived as someone who's always happy,\u00a0then you won't get treated as carefully as someone who might go ballistic every now and then.\" At 18, he fired his business manager (\"He\u00a0reacted as poorly as someone who's getting fired could possibly react\") and in 2008 he fell out with Harvey Weinstein over the marketing of the Kevin Smith comedy Zack And Miri Make A Porno \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but then \"he's a well-documented psychopath. He was using some of Judd's movies to sell that movie, which was specifically bad because it threatened one of my closest relationships, and I\u00a0was working with Judd at the time.\"Goldberg, Rogen's writing partner of over a\u00a0decade, says: \"He is a big neurotic Jew. That's why shit turns out so well. I'm the one who's too mellow. If he was left to his own devices, he'd worry himself into a hole in the ground. Everybody thinks, because we make these so-called slacker comedies, all we do is sit around all day and smoke weed and jerk off and our jizz kinda pools and becomes the movie. Seth's been working his ass off since he was 13. Seth and Sacha Baron Cohen and Judd Apatow are the hardest-working people in the world. They're extremely driven.\"When Jonah Hill was trying to figure out whether to take a part in Michael Bay's robot blockbuster Transformers, Rogen told him: \"Make your own movie about fightin' robots. You can do that. That's on the table now.\" Hill turned the role down. When James Franco found himself taking the biggest flak of his career, over Flyboys and Tristan + Isolde, Rogen also gave him some advice. \"I'd had my doubts about them, but I didn't have faith in what I\u00a0was doing, or that my taste was good enough,\" Franco says. \"Seth told me, 'Don't act in any movie you wouldn't ordinarily go see on your own if you weren't in it.' Of course! Of course you should work this way, but I didn't get it.\"Not that Rogen has always taken his own advice. After Knocked Up and Superbad together took almost $300m in the summer of 2007, he found himself able to get almost anything green-lit. The\u00a0result was The Green Hornet, an expensive superhero flick that struggled to recoup its $130m budget after a costly last-minute 3D conversion. \"The Green Hornet was such a fucking nightmare when we were making it that it would have been a miracle if it turned into something that was in any way even presentable,\" Rogen says. Then there was The Guilt Trip, his 2012 road movie with Barbra Streisand playing his mother. \"Again, the script was really great, but as we were making it, there was just a sense: this is not making us laugh really hard. And, honestly, the one thing those movies have in common is they're both PG-13. I tried for a\u00a0year or two to think that I could be really funny in that universe, and I think what I've learned for now is I just can't. It's not as fun. What makes us laugh is really dirty, sick, edgy shit.\"Hence his palpable relief about This Is The End, and the opportunity it offers him to get back on the right side of the joke. On its opening night in the US, it took $7.8m, and after five days it had taken $32.8m, recouping its entire budget. That first evening, Rogen, Goldberg, Baruchel and Hill went on an unannounced Hollywood cinema crawl, to see how the film was playing. It's a tradition they have whenever one of their movies opens. \"We all go in a bunch of cars, and go to four or five theatres and peek in to see the people laugh,\" Goldberg says. \"Half the fun is the first few days. That's really where it's at.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tWith Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Seth had his comic persona when he was 16,' says Judd Apatow. 'He was already this gruff, kind-hearted person.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\t\t\t\n            \nJudd Apatow first noticed Rogen's gift for tender-hearted vulgarity while shooting the TV series Freaks And Geeks in the late 1990s. \"He had his comic persona the first time I met him, when he was 16,\" he recalls. \"He was already that guy. He\u00a0had this gruff, WC Fields kind of personality, but\u00a0you could tell that beneath it there was a very kind-hearted person.\" This nonjudgmental streak can be traced back to his parents, Mark and Sandy, both lefty social workers, who encouraged sex talk in the house and gave Rogen lifts to and from Vancouver's comedy clubs when he started doing standup aged 13. \"He was raised around a lot of understanding and kindness,\" Apatow says. \"If you meet his parents, they're very accepting of who he is. They adore him, and they like being around each other. There are very few people who want to spend a ton of time with their parents. When Seth's parents are around, he's thrilled to have them.\"The only thing lacking was money. When Rogen was 16, his father lost his job and his mother quit hers; they put their house up for sale and moved to a smaller apartment. \"We had enough money. I\u00a0was fine, I had toys, I had clothes. We weren't living in a car or anything, I wasn't Jewel,\" he says, eliciting a snigger from the makeup girl preparing in the corner of the room. Rogen beams. \"But I was just aware that we lived in a\u00a0shittier neighbourhood than my friends and that our house wasn't nearly as big. And that I\u00a0was the only guy that was supposed to be going to a different high school, because the high school I\u00a0was supposed to be going to, I would have gotten my ass kicked every day.\"He met Goldberg in barmitzvah classes after their schools merged. Goldberg remembers one barmitzvah in particular out of the 36 they attended that year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for their friend Julia Moranis, the model for the Emma Stone character in Superbad \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when \"everything clicked. As soon as\u00a0we realised we weren't going to be kissing any girls that night, we started to hang out.\" At high school these two geeky Jewish kids with socialist families were suddenly thrust into a big scary world of towering, beautiful 17- and 18-year-olds. \"We were fucked,\" Goldberg says, finding common cause with Rogen and a third friend, Sammy Fogell, in \"this sense of being totally overwhelmed when we got to high school. I really think high school was one of these reasons we all have these tight friendships. Me and him and Fogell went through so much stuff together.\"Their friendships, mishaps and furtive lusts found their way into Superbad, which they began writing in their teens. \"The story was exactly the same: guys trying to buy beers for a\u00a0girl, and one of the guys gets taken by cops and the other guy goes on this adventure,\" Rogen recalls. \"What actually happened around that time, while we were writing the movie, was I was moving to LA and Evan went to college with one of our best friends in Montreal. I was left alone and they went off together. And what we didn't realise was, that's in a way what we were really writing about. It took Judd to tell us that. We were 18 years old, so we were still experiencing it. Then we wrote that into it and liked it so much we were like: we\u00a0should start with that next time.\"All their collaborations since have been elaborations on that bromance theme. \"Besides their marriages, they are the closest relationships in each other's lives,\" Hill says of Rogen and Goldberg. \"They work together, hang out every day.\" So we've had dudes missing other dudes at the end of high school (Superbad), dudes hitting the road together to escape bad drug dealers (Pineapple Express) and now dudes spooning one another during the apocalypse. The Green Hornet failed because the superhero and his assistant Kato weren't allowed to be dudes enough. \"We\u00a0really suffered from not being allowed to have Kato say to him, 'You can suck my fucking dick,'\u00e2\u0080\u008a\" Goldberg says. \"We feel we are being fake when we aren't swearing much of the time. When\u00a0my mom got breast cancer, she wasn't like, 'Aw shucks. Goddarn cancer.' She was like, 'This is the fucking worst.' When you take away the bad language, it degrades and dehumanises the whole thing. I think that's why people think our movies have heart, because when shit hits the fan, that's how people speak.\"Their biggest argument \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about a small tssking sound Rogen makes when he thinks an idea is dumb \u00e2\u0080\u0093 happened when they were still in their teens. \"We had a conversation where I was like, 'If\u00a0you do that again, I'm going to fucking kill you,'\u00e2\u0080\u008a\" Goldberg says. \"\u00e2\u0080\u008a'Stop making that noise.' And he's like, 'Well, OK\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What do I say?' 'Just say,\u00a0\"That's a stupid fucking idea.\"\u00e2\u0080\u008a' We kind of went through each other's personalities and out\u00a0the other side.\"If Superbad showed they could write a\u00a0movie, Pineapple Express showed they could write and produce a movie. This Is The End now demonstrates to the studios that they can write, direct, produce and star in a movie. It's an impressive beachhead to have secured. \"I don't want to underplay how significant this whole deal is for us,\" Goldberg says. \"Once you've directed something, no matter how shitty it is, they kind of let you keep doing it.\"It's producing that's hard, they say, in which case the figure to keep an eye on is the $31m for which they made This Is The End. That's the stuff of sainthood in Hollywood, and a deal they will be able to repeat ad infinitum if the movie is a hit, although some critics have pounced on the title. Is it to be taken literally? Both Rogen and Goldberg are married now. In 2011, Rogen wed his long-time girlfriend, Lauren Miller, a\u00a0comedy writer he met while working on Da Ali G Show in the late 1990s. Goldberg's wife worked on Bridesmaids. It's a far cry from the geeky adolescents who couldn't get a date in high school. Are they maturing? And, if so, can their audience be counted on to grow up alongside them?\"We get asked that a lot,\" Goldberg says, a\u00a0little\u00a0wearily.\"We do still engage in, like, life,\" Rogen says. \"I\u00a0drove here myself. I'm not some very insulated person who flies on private jets and gets taken everywhere by drivers.\" He says of marriage: \"I'm\u00a0sure it affects things to some degree. We don't fight that. Me and Evan are thinking of writing a movie with Judd, actually, about couples who are\u00a0married and about to get married, so it's nice when something new happens. It gives you more fodder.\" Their forthcoming projects include a\u00a0comedy about a guy who's having a baby but doesn't want to stop partying; an animated film Rogen has been trying to make for years; and The\u00a0Interview, which reunites Rogen with Franco \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the pair play journalists who go to interview Kim Jong-un and get mixed up in a CIA plot to assassinate him. His advice to Franco \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only make the movies you want to see yourself \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has finally come home.\"I honestly think we stopped doing that for a\u00a0few years,\" Rogen says. \"We got caught up in trying to make the movies we had opportunities to make. With this one and the next ones, we figured shit out a little bit more. We're back to making the craziest shit you could possibly be doing. We're not trying to settle into some safe zone. The more we make movies, the more we realise that the fun of making movies is taking the\u00a0chance that we could be doing something disastrously bad.\"\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This Is The End is released on Friday 28 June.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "He's made his name playing the laidback stoner.

It has won the film, radio, PR, direct and integrated categories.It is the second year running that the top film award has gone to a campaign with a social message \u00e2\u0080\u0094 US fast food chain Chipotle won last year with a similarly-styled animation-with-music ad about sustainable farming and production.Channel 4's Meet the Superhumans campaign to change the image of Paralympic athletes ahead of the London 2012 Games, which featured the Public Enemy track Harder Than You Think, picked up a Gold Lion.Sir John Hegarty, co-founder of ad agency BBH and president of the 23-strong jury, said of the campaign: \"When you've got some really outstanding work it is tragic in some ways it can't get a bigger award, but there can only be one grand prix\".Jury member Carlo Cavallone, executive creative director at agency 72andsunny, expanded on the judging process: \"[Meet the Superhumans] is an amazing campaign, one of the golds that went through [the judging process] immediately,\" he said. \"Everyone felt it had the highest level of craft. It puts an issue that was really important before London 2012 to raise awareness of the Paralympics [and] they were hyper successful \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Dumb Ways to Die was a tough contender. Amazing music piece, amazing editing.\"WPP-owned agency Ogilvy & Mather picked up a gold for a Unilever Dove campaign. Mother London won a gold for a campaign for Ikea.The Australian ad industry is on something of a creative hot streak with Tourism Queensland's \"best job in the world campaign\", a cleverly exploited stunt to find a caretaker for an Australian paradise island, scooping three grand prix awards in 2009.The jury took the highly unusual step of awarding two grand prix awards in the film category this year. The other was given to a long-form piece of online video content from Intel and Toshiba. The campaign was shot as a six-part miniseries about a man who wakes up every day as a different person.The only other time that there has been a joint winner in the film category in the 60-year history of the awards was in 2008. That year Cadbury's drumming gorilla TV ad had to share the top award with a viral campaign for Xbox's Halo 3 game.The jury was somewhat disdainful about a growing trend of agencies submitting very long pieces of video content used for online campaigns.Hegarty said that just because the internet is free of the restrictions of the time limits governing TV ads does not mean that agencies should make long online video pieces.\"There is a great danger in that word 'long-formk,'\" he said. \"One of the great things about films is the ability to edit.\"Jury member Ant Keogh gave a warning to agencies to think hard before submitting long-form TV series-like content for judging in future. \"Is it as good as an HBO show? [Because] that is what you are up against,\" he said.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Integrated Grand Prix goes to campaign by McCann Melbourne, while Channel 4's Meet the

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/22/fashion-industry-no-ethics#start-of-comments", "text": "\n\t    Since getting itself talked about was the only comprehensible reason why a lifestyle magazine would run a suicide-themed fashion spread, last week's internationally condemned fashion spread on suicide was a triumph for a publication that one might, in a supremely futile act of resistance, not bother to name. The whole thing could hardly have gone better: from publication of \"Last Words\", to the first tweeted expressions of outrage, to lengthy condemnatory articles, to withdrawal of the offending piece, and the editors' widely publicised semi-grovel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all within 24 hours.Throughout, the publication responsible was introduced in news stories as \"the hipster's bible\", a trusted, super-edgy brand, new readers learned, for the kind of dashing young iconoclasts who dress in Prada or Issa \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a couple of the labels into which the fashion team had inserted models pretending to be famous women writers just after, or in a more how-to mode, in the act of, suicide. One of the late writers has a living, 11-year-old son. In its apology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which will have doubled as a perfect, hi, subscribe and we'll send you 12 issues per year opportunity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the editors explained that their fashion spreads \"are always unconventional\".The women suicides shoot, for instance, was a hipsterish way of focusing \"on the demise of a set of writers whose lives we very much wish weren't cut tragically short, especially at their own hands\". Just as you might, say, use a fashion spread to focus on the demise of a set of underpaid garment workers whose lives you wished weren't cut tragically short, especially in a collapsed building.Once it's explained, you get that posing demised bodies in the latest must-haves is an unconventional fash way of showing you care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so long, obviously, that no clothes are harmed in the process. And that shockwaves are bound to be created, among non-hipsters, when fashion is approached this way, as the magazine puts it, \"with an art editorial point of view rather than a typical fashion photo-editorial one\".Now the only people who could be offended by that excuse, surely, are the many rival fashion magazines who work, no less tirelessly, and with an equal disregard for convention, to ensure that their own work resembles art and not \"typical fashion photo-editorial\". Think, for example, of the current Interview magazine sequence, in which pathological hoarding, rather than suicide, is having a moment. In \"The Hoarder\", this magazine's study in mental disorder/fash contrasts, a pallid beauty poses amid piled-up filth and chaos. \"She's a contemporary Miss Havisham, as modernity meets tradition and classically tailored coats and jackets meet exaggerated boots and enormous wedges,\" runs the caption, referencing fashion's favourite \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if non-hoarding \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Dickens character: \"Here comes pre-Fall.\"Cond\u00c3\u00a9 Nast staff, too, must be justifiably affronted by the suggestion that the suicide-fashion team have the monopoly on in-your-face fashion provocation. Was not Vogue Italia, a few years back, the first to show models looking dead in a polluted, seaside context, \"precious reportage that delivers an artistic impact\"? The photographer Steven Meisel laid the model Kristen McMenamy out like, sort of, BP's dead seabirds, if they, too, had expired in tastefully wrecked Ralph Lauren and Clinique. \"She keeps her skin golden thanks to Self Tan Face Bronzing Gel Tint (to wear alone or with foundation),\" is how Vogue glossed the desperate scene, with the pragmatic attention to detail that distinguishes this field of artistic endeavour: \"It takes care of the skin, while giving it a hint of colour.\"If last week's suicide creatives did not, incomprehensible as this might seem, ever consider issues of taste or responsibility, as this exercise in suicide trivialisation progressed from being deliciously out there into a glossy finished product, it could be because the absence of principles is, in so many respects, still vital to fashion industry profits. Start obsessing about taste and responsibility and where will it all stop? If fashion editors conceded, for instance, the case against dressing up death and illness to sell tights and enormous wedges and, thereby, advertising space, they might, in no time, be confronting equally difficult questions about their glamorising of emaciation, and of allegedly tax-evading designers and of tyranny, in those ever popular, meet-the-psychopath's-wife slots.As much as the invention of ethical fashion has raised awareness of the pollution and human exploitation intrinsic to an industry built on waste, it may also have contributed, less usefully, to an expectation that, if only fashion could guarantee carbon neutrality and fair trade, it would emerge as, if not 100% wholesome, no worse than any other form of cultural production. If greenness and improved sweatshops are all it needs to be ethical, we can look forward to John Galliano's ethical antisemitism, Ralph Lauren's ethical bribery and Dolce and Gabbana's ethical tax-evasion. Or how about a new line in ethical interviews in which we find, say, Asma al-Assad, Vogue's \"Anon GM Rose in the Desert\", in scrupulously vintage Loubs, with a special message about sustainable oppression?Going further in the application of ethics to fashion, it may not be fanciful to imagine a time when the regular distribution of clothes, accessories and beauty products, gifts whereby legions of fashion writers, celebrities and bloggers are groomed by fashion PRs into a condition of helpless adulation, is restricted to strictly recyclable items.It's more difficult, though, to see how eco-friendly ethics would influence some equally long-established fashion traditions, such as paying Hollywood names to sit, fan-like, in the front row or, equally, persecuting journalists who have misused that privilege.Thanks to a few journalists, including Liz Jones, Laura Craik and the Guardian's Hadley Freeman, who was once banned from his show by national treasure Paul Smith, the public is gaining some appreciation of the human cost of keeping fashion coverage permanently ecstatic, about absolutely everything.When, for example, Cathy Horyn, fashion editor of the New York Times, advertised her eight-year exclusion from his shows, an exercised Hedi Slimane, the Saint Laurent designer, confirmed that, for all that it's now the stuff of doting V&A and Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibitions, fashion remains altogether too fabulous an art to be subjected to normal rules of critical engagement.Horyn was, Slimane said , a \"schoolyard bully\", \"thick\" and, style-wise, \"seriously challenged\". Publishers and theatre directors must dream, reading stuff like this, of enjoying the same power to insult and exclude unhelpful journalists, without surrendering a fraction of the esteem they enjoy among more amenable critics or, at any rate, among the ones who depend on their advertising or handbags.For, like designer tax evasion, garment sweatshops and the fate of tissue-eating models, the suborning of the media is too delicate a question to detain upscale fashion reportage while being, at the same time, too commonplace to outrage everyone else.\n    ", "og:type": "article",

refuse to perform the practice on ethical grounds have got nowhere, a spokesman for the prison said on Thursday.No doctors, nurses or corpsman had balked at feeding the prisoners or even voiced a concern about the military's policy of using what's known as enteral feeding to prevent any of the hunger strikers starving to death, said Navy Captain Robert Durand.\"They signed up to carry out lawful orders,\" Durand said. \"This is a lawful order.\"The hunger strike at the US base in Cuba is nearing a fourth month amid increasing pressure on the defence department to reconsider its response to the protest.Officials said 104 of the 166 prisoners were on hunger strike as of Thursday in a protest against their indefinite detention. Up to 44 are strapped down each day and force-fed liquid nutrients through a nasal tube. \"We do it to preserve life,\" Durand said, denying the assertions from prisoners that the procedure is painful.On Wednesday, Dianne Feinstein, the head of the Senate intelligence committee, released a letter she wrote to the defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, after visiting Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo in which she urged the Pentagon to re-evaluate the treatment of the hunger strikers, saying \"the current approach raises very important ethical questions\".The American Medical Association's president wrote to Hagel in April to say that force-feeding hunger strikers violated core ethical values of the medical profession. A recent editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine urged Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo's prison doctors to refuse to take part.A lawyer for one of the prisoners charged before a military commission in the September 11 attacks sought unsuccessfully this week to raise the hunger strike during a pretrial hearing in the case.Navy lieutenant commander Walter Ruiz said his client had refused meals but was not classified as a hunger striker by prison officials. Nevertheless he sought an order from the judge to bar the use of force-feeding. Prosecutors opposed the motion as not relevant.\"The reality is that it's not the preservation of a life,\" Ruiz said of force-feeding. \"It's the preservation of existence. There is no life. In essence, by keeping these people here we have already killed their soul, and their spirit and taken away their dignity.\"The judge, army colonel James Pohl, declined to take up the motion. Ruiz said he would continue to press the issue.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Prison spokesman says no medical staff have expressed concerns about the treatment of hunger strikers",

could be free before the end of the decade after he was given a shorter sentence as a result of an agreement with prosecutors. Jeff Skilling, who was originally sentenced to more than 24 years in 2006, was resentenced to 14 years at a court in Houston on Friday.A federal judge in signed off on an agreement betwee Skilling and federal prosecutors, under which he will drop his appeal and forfeit $40m in assets seized by the government. Skilling was given the longest sentence of any executive involved in the 2001 collapse of Enron, once one of the world's largest energy companies. The company's fall was one of the biggest business scandals of the decade, costing thousands their jobs and wiping out billions for shareholders and pensioners.In May 2006, Skilling was convicted on 19 charges including conspiracy, insider trading, securities fraud and making false statements to auditors. US district judge Sim Lake sentenced Skilling to 292 months \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than 24 years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in prison.The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay, was also found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy and fraud. He died of heart failure six weeks after the trial ended.An appeals court ruled in 2009 that Skilling had been the victim of misapplied sentencing guidelines, a ruling that made inevitable a reduction in his sentence. Skilling's resentencing was delayed for years, however, as he fought to overturn his convictions. He has consistently maintained his innocence.In 2010 the supreme court ruled one of Skilling's convictions was flawed and that prosecutors had overreached themselves using the \"honest services\" fraud law. But that decision did not lead to a retrial, as Skilling had hoped. In May prosecutors brokered a deal with Skilling to reduce his sentence in return for the end of his appeals and an agreement to forfeit the seized assets.Enron's collapse wiped out more than $2bn in employee pensions, $60bn in Enron stock and cost thousands their jobs. The $40m seized by the government will be distributed to victims of Enron's fraud.\"The investigation and prosecution of [Skilling] has been ongoing for more than 10 years,\" the agreement stated. \"The government has invested extraordinary resources into this case during a lengthy investigation, pre-trial litigation, trial and extensive post-trial litigation before the District court, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. In the absence of this agreement, the parties anticipate substantial ongoing litigation. By the terms of this agreement, [Skilling's] convictions will become final.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Former chief executive could be released before the end of the decade

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/21/nba-finals-miami-heat-lebron-james", "text": "\n\t    LeBron James's legacy was going to come down to a single game. Again. The success and failure of his entire season, the season that was supposed to catapult him into the discussion of all-time greats, would be decided in the \"anything can happen\" uncertainty of a Game 7. Not that the pressure was too much for the Miami Heat forward; after all, James had plenty of time to get used to such instant evaluation and re-evaluation.As the 2013 postseason progressed, the discussion would flip, game by game, from \"LeBron James and the Miami Heat are on the threshold of becoming one of the greatest teams of all time\" to \"LeBron James and the Miami Heat are about to become huge chokers\". The Heat followed every momentum-building win with an equally deflating loss. Luckily for James, and unfortunately for his critics, the Heat finally ended their trend of not winning back-to-back games right when they needed it the most. A game away from elimination at the hands of the San Antonio Spurs, the Heat first won Game 6 on Tuesday night, thanks to a great fourth-quarter effort from James. Then he followed it up with a 37-point Game 7 effort that clinched him NBA Finals MVP honors for the second year in a row.Even Thursday night's win might not be good enough, however, by the standards with which we judge James and the Heat. The Heat won, yes, but did they have to make it so difficult? For much of the season, after all, James was playing basketball at a level we haven't seen since a certain former White Sox farmhand/underclothes spokesperson/Looney Toons movie co-star was at his peak. When the Heat went on a 27-game winning streak, the second-longest in NBA history, there was talk that this squad was possibly the greatest NBA team of all time. These are the limits, hyperbolic as they may seem, of what's possible when LeBron and his teammates are playing their best.Then came the postseason: Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh faltered down the stretch, James couldn't quite carry the team on his own and the Indiana Pacers took the Heat, who were supposed to be absolute locks to make the Finals and possibly even go \"fo' fo' fo'\" on their way there, to the full seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Then the Heat alternated wins throughout the Finals with the Spurs. Yes, eventually a would-be game-tying Tim Duncan tip-in went awry and the Heat survived, but did James, and to a lesser extent his team, really win the championship in a dominant enough fashion, considering the potential they flashed during the regular season? These are the standards, as ridiculous as they might seem, by which we judge LeBron James. (The satirical SportsPickle nailed this impulse early Friday morning, with their article \"LeBron James Still 62 Rings Short Of Having All the NBA Titles in History\".)The NBA is really \"The LeBron Show\", and it has been for quite some time, even if nobody's been able to tell if he is the hero or the villain, or if the show's being funny on purpose. For his first few years in Cleveland, James looked like he was going to be the hometown hero (he's really an Akron native, but close enough) who would lead the Cavaliers to a long-deserved championship. Then \"the Decision\" happened, and James bolted to Miami to join Wade and Bosh in what was promoted as an instant dynasty. As high as the expectations surrounding Miami's Big Three have been, James is at least partially to blame for setting them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 most notably when he promised, during a televised parade, that his new team would win \"not one, not two, not three \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" but eight championships. That moment of ill-advised boasting effectively became Cleveland LeBron's epitaph, and a millstone around the neck of Miami LeBron. Following the Decision and the tacky pre-victory celebration, James went from being one of the most admired athletes in America to maybe the most hated, complete with public jersey-burnings and the creation of a cottage industry primarily dedicated to anti-LeBron media product.When the Heat first came together in 2010, the talk was that the formation of its Big Three had permanently tainted LeBron's legacy. After all, Michael Jordan or Bill Russell didn't have to join somebody else's team to win like James did, jumping aboard a Heat team that Wade had already led to a championship in 2006. During the 2010-11 season many still believed the Heat were Wade's team, and LeBron would have to be his sidekick (talk which seems extra surreal after seeing a hobbled Wade struggle through this postseason). The LeBron-hatred climaxed when the Heat were humbled, losing to the underdog Dallas Mavericks in the 2011 NBA Finals.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tLebron James is blocked by Jason Kidd during Game 5 of the 2011 NBA Finals. Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nOddly enough, that epic upset seemed to be enough penance for some \u00e2\u0080\u0093maybe not the majority and certainly few in the Cleveland area \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to reevaluate James's play in the next season. Maybe it was more of a backlash to the backlash \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at this point ESPN were basically paying Skip Bayless to start each edition of First Take with an Orwellian Two-to-Five Minute Hate on LeBron \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in 2011-12 there was more of an appreciation of James's once-in-a-generation talent. When James finally won his ring, riding a transformational Game 6 in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics to a five-game dismantling of Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals, the best of all time conversation continued. Now he had a ring, the jokes were replaced, mostly, by fawning articles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or at the very least, grudging admissions along the lines of \"even if you don't like the guy, you have to respect him\". The season just finished was supposed to be something of a victory lap. No team looked better in the regular season. The Heat looked so unbeatable during their 27-game streak that the usual suspects were calling the Chicago Bulls' streak-ending victory \"the greatest NBA regular-season game ever played\". As key players on their serious competitors fell to injuries, first in the East (Chicago's Derrick Rose, Boston's Rajon Rondo) and then in the West (the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, the Thunder's Russell Westbrook), it looked as if there weren't going to be any serious hurdles in the Heat's quest for back-to-back championships. At the start of the playoffs, the \"easy road to the Finals narrative\" played out, as Miami swept the Milwaukee Bucks and rattled off four straight wins against the Bulls following an unexpected Game 1 loss. Before the start of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pacers didn't really look like they would offer much of a challenge. Then the games started. It was clear that an injured Wade and an invisible Bosh would be so for most of the series, although Wade would pull off an unexpected throwback performance. The Heat were unable to pull off back-to-back victories over Roy Hibbert, Paul George and a surprisingly tenacious Pacers team. If the Pacers had won this series, there would have major changes in the offseason. (Heck, it actually remains a possibility, if the championship glow doesn't quite cover up the evidence of Chris Bosh's mostly dreadful June.)Even though the Heat were able to hold off the Pacers in Game 7, at home, they were suddenly vulnerable. At the start of the playoffs, in mid-April, they seemed likely to have a massive advantage over whoever would be their opponent in the Finals. Come June, the Spurs and the Heat looked like something close to equals. The Spurs had just emerged from a surprising sweep of the much heralded Memphis Grizzlies, getting plenty of time to rest while the Pacers were pushing the Heat to the full distance. The Finals were a punch/counter-punch affair. Tony Parker's miracle game winner in Game 1 was answered by LeBron James's block on Tiago Splitter in Game 2, and the teams traded wins for the first five games. When the Heat returned home to American Airlines Arena with the Spurs holding a 3-2 series lead, this looked like it was going to be the setup for their biggest embarrassment yet. The Spurs were one win away from giving James a 1-3 record in the NBA Finals, which began with these Spurs' 2007 beatdown of James's Cavaliers and reached its peak with the \"LeBron James Doesn't Have a Fourth Quarter\" Heat/Mavericks series of 2011.The Heat's postseason finally turned for good with a crazy fourth quarter in Game 6, when James finally took over the game. James scored 14 points in the last quarter of regulation, setting the scene for Ray Allen's game-tying three-pointer that sent both teams to overtime, and he then made the field goal that put his team ahead for good in the extras. (The first two questions to James after the game were, as one would assume, about whether or not the fact that he lost his iconic headband was the reason for his offensive outburst. Maybe his most notable power has nothing to do with basketball itself \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe it's his unique ability to make all of us in the sports media say incredibly dumb things about and to him.)The end of Game 6 turned out to be a prelude to his Game 7 performance. Along with a rejuvenated Wade, who was suddenly able to hit jumpers again, and a surprising night from the beyond-an-afterthought Shane Battier, who hit six three-pointers and remarked \"it's better to be timely than good\", James helped carry the Heat by putting up 37 points, 12 rebounds and four assists in an evening where Bosh, Mike Miller and Ray Allen combined for zero points. His biggest shot of the year might have been a jumper he hit with 28 seconds left to make it a 92-88 game in the Heat's favor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the kind of clutch basket that his critics always said he never could make.\n\t\n\tJames's performance in the 95-88 Heat win made it inevitable that he would win Finals MVP two years in a row. With back-to-back regular season MVPs and back-to-back Finals MVPs, he has done something only accomplished by Bill Russell and Michael Jordan. Russell and Jordan are, of course, two of a handful of all-time greats that LeBron is always playing against, despite the fact that they are both retired symbols of earlier ages. The kicker here is the knowledge that had James done anything less, or even if he had just as much (or even more) and the Heat had lost, this season would have been portrayed as a complete failure. This is what has been expected from him since he joined Wade and Bosh. Following Thursday night's win,  Wade, now calling himself \"Three\", had fun with the media, the fans celebrated in Miami and soon there will be a parade. But then? Then the discussion about the next season of \"The LeBron Show\" will continue, and everyone will start wondering if the Heat can win three championships in a row. You know, Michael Jordan pulled off two three-peats in his Chicago Bulls career, right, so it's basically a total choke-job if LeBron can't manage it at least once, right? (Oh and you're too late, by the way, someone has already trademarked \"Three-Heat\".)So LeBron James has led the Miami Heat to their second straight championship. But there's a certain \"well, what took you so long\" feel to the response. It wasn't supposed to be this hard for a team supposedly this great, after all, and they really shouldn't have suffered so many playoff losses. (No seriously. This is a thing.) It may or may not be his fault, but the expectations raised by James when he made his Decision have raised the stakes so high that there isn't so much joy as there is relief when they end the NBA season with a victory. Even though the Heat have won one of the most exciting and downright fun NBA Finals in recent memory, it still feels like they merely accomplished what they were supposed to do. The Heat have, to borrow a particularly soul-killing bit of athlete-speak, just done their jobs.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Hunter Felt: LeBron James played a great Game 7 but

trial of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who says he shot an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in self-defense.Prosecutors have said Zimmerman, 29, racially profiled the 17-year-old Martin as he walked back from a convenience store on February 26, 2012, in the rain, wearing a dark hooded shirt. Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.The race and ethnicity of the sixth jury member was not immediately available.Prosecutors and defense attorneys chose the panel of six jurors after almost two weeks of jury selection. In Florida, 12 jurors are required only for criminal trials involving capital cases, when the death penalty is being considered.Martin's shooting death and the initial decision not to charge Zimmerman led to public outrage and demonstrations around the nation, with some accusing Sanford police of failing to thoroughly investigate the shooting.The six jurors were culled from a pool of 40 jury candidates who made it into a second round of jury questioning.Before selecting the jurors Thursday, defense attorney Mark O'Mara explored potential jurors' views on whether they thought sympathy should play a role in deciding a case. Juror B-72, a young Hispanic man, said he wasn't affected by sympathetic people because he's never had many close relationships.\"So when a person might seem sympathetic, to me it's indifferent,\" he said.O'Mara also asked the jurors about when they thought self-defense could be used. Juror H-6, a white man in his 30s, said he thought deadly force could be warranted if a person feels danger.\"I feel that if you're somewhere you're supposed to be and allowed to be, you should have the right to defend yourself,\" he said.O'Mara met resistance from the judge when he tried to characterize the definition for justifiable use of deadly force.Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda objected multiple times during O'Mara's line of questioning, eventually leading to Judge Debra Nelson to twice read what will be the jury instruction once the final jury is selection.\"I don't want either side to give an interpretation on the law,\" Nelson said.O'Mara said screening the prospective jurors for any biases or prejudices \"is probably as critical if not more critical than the evidence.\"\"If you bring that into the courtroom, then what we can't get is a fair verdict,\" he said.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Prosecutors and defence attorneys choose six-person panel after

been put out of joint in the wine industry, with experiments showing that even experts can't always tell cheap plonk from grand cru.  David Derbyshire reports on the chemistry behind the taste", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis", "text": "\n\t    Every year Robert Hodgson selects the finest wines from his small California winery and puts them into competitions around the state.And in most years, the results are surprisingly inconsistent: some whites rated as gold medallists in one contest do badly in another. Reds adored by some panels are dismissed by others. Over the decades Hodgson, a softly spoken retired oceanographer, became curious. Judging wines is by its nature subjective, but the awards appeared to be handed out at random.So drawing on his background in statistics, Hodgson approached the organisers of the California State Fair wine competition, the oldest contest of its kind in North America, and proposed an experiment for their annual June tasting sessions.Each panel of four judges would be presented with their usual \"flight\" of samples to sniff, sip and slurp. But some wines would be presented to the panel three times, poured from the same bottle each time. The results would be compiled and analysed to see whether wine testing really is scientific.The first experiment took place in 2005. The last was in Sacramento earlier this month. Hodgson's findings have stunned the wine industry. Over the years he has shown again and again that even trained, professional palates are terrible at judging wine.\"The results are disturbing,\" says Hodgson from the Fieldbrook Winery in Humboldt County, described by its owner as a rural paradise. \"Only about 10% of judges are consistent and those judges who were consistent one year were ordinary the next year.\"Chance has a great deal to do with the awards that wines win.\"These judges are not amateurs either. They read like a who's who of the American wine industry from winemakers, sommeliers, critics and buyers to wine consultants and academics. In Hodgson's tests, judges rated wines on a scale running from 50 to 100. In practice, most wines scored in the 70s, 80s and low 90s.Results from the first four years of the experiment, published in the Journal of Wine Economics, showed a typical judge's scores varied by plus or minus four points over the three blind tastings. A wine deemed to be a good 90 would be rated as an acceptable 86 by the same judge minutes later and then an excellent 94.Some of the judges were far worse, others better \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with around one in 10 varying their scores by just plus or minus two. A few points may not sound much but it is enough to swing a contest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and gold medals are worth a significant amount in extra sales for wineries.Hodgson went on to analyse the results of wine competitions across California, and found that their medals were distributed at random.\"I think there are individual expert tasters with exceptional abilities sitting alone who have a good sense, but when you sit 100 wines in front of them the task is beyond human ability,\" he says. \"We have won our fair share of gold medals but now I have to say we were lucky.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tRobert Parker, above is the world's leading wine critic and his score is key to determining the price of a new vintage. But Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton economist, invented a simple mathematical formula based on weather data to predict the price of vintages, which mimicked the predictions of Parker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system. Photograph: Shahar Azran/WireImage\n\t\t\t\n            \nHis studies have irritated many figures in the industry. \"They say I'm full of bullshit but that's OK. I'm proud of what I do. It's part of my academic background to find the truth.''Hodgson isn't alone in questioning the science of wine-tasting. French academic Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Brochet tested the effect of labels in 2001. He presented the same Bordeaux superior wine to 57 volunteers a week apart and in two different bottles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one for a table wine, the other for a grand cru.The tasters were fooled.When tasting a supposedly superior wine, their language was more positive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 describing it as complex, balanced, long and woody. When the same wine was presented as plonk, the critics were more likely to use negatives such as weak, light and flat.In 2008 a study of 6,000 blind tastings by Robin Goldstein in the Journal of Wine Economics found a positive link between the price of wine and the amount people enjoyed it. But the link only existed for people trained to detect the elements of wine that make them expensive.In 2011 Professor Richard Wiseman, a psychologist (and former professional magician) at Hertfordshire University invited 578 people to comment on a range of red and white wines, varying from \u00c2\u00a33.49 for a claret to \u00c2\u00a330 for champagne, and tasted blind.People could tell the difference between wines under \u00c2\u00a35 and those above \u00c2\u00a310 only 53% of the time for whites and only 47% of the time for reds. Overall they would have been just as a successful flipping a coin to guess.So why are ordinary drinkers and the experts so poor at tasting blind? Part of the answer lies in the sheer complexity of wine.For a drink made by fermenting fruit juice, wine is a remarkably sophisticated chemical cocktail. Dr Bryce Rankine, an Australian wine scientist, identified 27 distinct organic acids in wine, 23 varieties of alcohol in addition to the common ethanol, more than 80 esters and aldehydes, 16 sugars, plus a long list of assorted vitamins and minerals that wouldn't look out of place on the ingredients list of a cereal pack. There are even harmless traces of lead and arsenic that come from the soil.Three of wine's most basic qualities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sweetness, sourness and bitterness \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are picked up by the tongue's taste buds. A good wine has the perfect balance of sweet from the sugar in grapes, sourness from the acids, particularly tartaric and malic acid, and bitterness from alcohol and polyphenols, including tannins.Many wines are more acidic than lemon juice and are only palatable because that acidity is balanced by sweetness and bitterness. \"It's the holy trinity of the palate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sugar, acid and alcohol,\" says Dr James Hutchinson, a wine expert at the Royal Society of Chemistry.Professionals distinguish between the balance of these three basic elements and a wine's flavour. And here the chemistry gets more complicated.The flavour of wine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 its aroma or bouquet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is detected not by the taste buds, but by millions of receptors in the olfactory bulb, a blob of nervous tissue where the brain meets the nasal passage.Chemists have identified at least 400 aroma compounds that work on their own and with others to create complex flavours \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some appearing immediately on first sniffing, others  emerging only as an aftertaste. Most of these are volatiles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 aromatic compounds that tend to have a low boiling point and waft away from glasses and tongues towards the olfactory bulb.Some of these, the primary volatiles, are present in the grape. Others, the secondaries, are generated by yeast activity during fermentation. The rest, the tertiary volatiles, are formed as wine matures in barrels or bottles.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tMore evidence that wine-tasting is influenced by context was provided by a 2008 study from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The team found that different music could boost tasters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wine scores by 60%. Researchers discovered that a blast of Jimi Hendrix  enhanced cabernet sauvignon while Kylie Minogue went well with chardonnay.\n\t\t\t\n            \nOver the last few decades, wine scientists have begun to identify the compounds responsible for some of the distinctive aromas in wine.The grassy, gooseberry quality of sauvignon blanc, for instance, comes from a class of chemicals called methoxypyrazines. These contain nitrogen and are byproducts of the metabolism of amino acids in the grape. Concentrations are higher in cooler climates, which is why New Zealand sauvignon blancs are often more herbaceous than Australian ones.The flowery aroma of muscat and gew\u00c3\u00bcrztraminer comes from a class of alcohol compounds called monoterpenes. These include linalool \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a substance also used in perfumes and insecticide \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and geraniol, a pale yellow liquid that doubles up as an effective mosquito repellent and gives geranium its distinctive smell.The spicy notes of chardonnay have been attributed to compounds called megastigmatrienones, also found in grapefruit juice.\"People underestimate how clever the olfactory system is at detecting aromas and our brain is at interpreting them,\" says Hutchinson.\"The olfactory system has the complexity in terms of its protein receptors to detect all the different aromas, but the brain response isn't always up to it. But I'm a believer that everyone has the same equipment and it comes down to learning how to interpret it.\" Within eight tastings, most people can learn to detect and name a reasonable range of aromas in wine, Hutchinson says.Detecting and finding the right vocabulary may  be within everyone's grasp. But when it comes to ranking wines, Hutchinson shares Robert Hodgson's concerns.\"There's a lot of nonsense and emperor's new clothes in the wine world,\" Hutchinson says. \"I have had a number of wines costing hundreds of pounds that have disappointed me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a number costing between \u00c2\u00a35 and \u00c2\u00a310 which have been absolutely surprising.\"People struggle with assessing wine because the brain's interpretation of aroma and bouquet is based on far more than the chemicals found in the drink. Temperature plays a big part. Volatiles in wine are more active when wine is warmer. Serve a New World chardonnay too cold and you'll only taste the overpowering oak. Serve a red too warm and the heady boozy qualities will be overpowering.Colour affects our perceptions too. In 2001 Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick Brochet of the University of Bordeaux asked 54 wine experts to test two glasses of wine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one red, one white. Using the typical language of tasters, the panel described the red as \"jammy' and commented on its crushed red fruit.The critics failed to spot that both wines were from the same bottle. The only difference was that one had been coloured red with a flavourless dye.Other environmental factors play a role. A judge's palate is affected by what she or he had earlier, the time of day, their tiredness, their health \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even the weather.For Hutchinson and Hodgson the unpredictability means that human scores of wines are of limited value.\"It's very subjective and there's a lot of politics marring it,\" says Hutchinson. \"People should use it as one indicator and not as an end-all. It would be a great sadness if people were only driven by what critics say.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tIs there a scientific basis for the belief that red wine does not go with seafood? Researchers from Japanese drinks firm Mercian tested 64 varieties of wine with scallops, and concluded that the iron content of red wine speeded up the decay of fish, resulting in an overly \u00e2\u0080\u0098fishy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 taste. Photograph: Alamy\n\t\t\t\n            \nSo if people cannot be relied on to judge wine, how about machines?\"In terms of replicating what a human can do we are a long way off,\" Hutchinson says. \"The one thing we can do well, though, is a lot of amazing analytical chemistry that allows us to detect a huge range of different compounds in a glass of wine.''We can start to have an indication of how the acidity balances with the sweetness and different levels of flavour compounds.\"But the step we haven't got to is how that raw chemical information can be crunched together and converted into something that reflects someone's emotional response. That might be something we can never achieve.\"Meanwhile the blind tasting contests go on. Robert Hodgson is determined to improve the quality of judging. He has developed a test that will determine whether a judge's assessment of a blind-tasted glass in a medal competition is better than chance. The research will be presented at a conference in Cape Town this year. But the early findings are not promising.\"So far I've yet to find someone who passes,\" he says.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Noses have been put out of joint in the wine industry, with experiments showing that even experts can't always tell cheap plonk from grand cru.

When we arrived in the late 70s it was before it had really been discovered, or written about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even as a travel destination. But it was a place people who were spiritual \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and artists \u00e2\u0080\u0093 knew of. I think it attracts those who want to connect with nature, and the city's incredible history.How much has growing up in Santa Fe moulded you as a person?There's so much art: visual, dance, theatre. All of a sudden, as a child, I was going to the opera for the first time in my life. This was back when the opera house was somewhat uncovered so you'd be watching the Magic Flute and the backdrop would be the mountains, the sky and you'd be sitting out under the stars hearing the most beautiful music. As an eight-year-old, that changes your life. I'm certain it steered me in the career direction I eventually chose.Since Breaking Bad, has Albuquerque had more visitors?Absolutely. There's actually now an unofficial tour, which is extraordinary. People make a day of it. When we were shooting at the car wash or the white house, the lovely people who own the white house, Fran and Louis, would tell us how people now knock on their door from all over the world. Sometimes they want to know if the pizza that Walt threw onto the roof is still up there.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tDesert destination. The New Mexico location for the 'cooking in the RV' scenes of Breaking Bad is a draw for fans. Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex\n\t\t\t\n            \nWhat is the best location to visit?All the places we filmed at are normal, everyday locations. Saul's office was just a storefront in the mini-mall. The art department put up that funny statue in front of it, so it doesn't even look that way. The most exciting thing would be the desert \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when they cooked out there in the RV. Although that would be a little harder to find, because it's in the middle of nowhere, I imagine people still try to find it. The train heist episode, which is\u00a0one of the newer ones, would be a really exciting location to check out. That's up close to Santa Fe, near Lamy, I believe.Has Breaking Bad changed the way you view the area?I think the way Michael Slovis, the art director, captured New Mexico was extraordinary. New Mexico becomes a character in the show and I can't imagine it being set anywhere else. He had this vision of it being like a Sergio Leone film and I think that really comes across, especially as Walt gets deeper into the crime and that old western feel develops.What is the best thing a visitor can experience in Albuquerque?    \n                \n\t\t\t\tAlbuquerque's hot air balloon fiesta. Photograph: Kevin Fleming/Corbis\n\t\t\t\n            \nThe balloon fiesta every October is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. There are hundreds of hot air balloons in all shapes and sizes. They try their best to land back in the park, but sometimes they land in people's backyards. One day I was doing the dishes and one landed outside my window.Where can you go to get a taste of Santa Fe?There's a restaurant called Cafe Pasqual's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 my brother worked there as a dishwasher when he was a kid. They have a big community table and they do this breakfast burrito, which, if you manage to eat it, will mean you're set for the day. If you want authentic Santa Fe food, go to the Five and Dime General Store on the Santa Fe Plaza where they sell amazing frito pies (chilli, cheese and corn chips). I used to have them as a kid and they still serve them.The soundtrack to Breaking Bad has received a lot of praise. Is there a particular song that reminds you of New Mexico?De Colores. I'm not sure if they used it in Breaking Bad but, whenever I\u00a0hear it, it reminds me of Santa Fe. It's a really traditional Mexican song you hear all the time. I remember hearing it as a kid and it just brings me back.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 For more information on holidays in the USA, visit DiscoverAmerica.com\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Having grown up in Santa Fe, actor Anna Gunn, best known as Skyler White in Breaking Bad, was thrilled to return to New Mexico to shoot the hit TV series.

wheat plants turned up on a farmer's field in Oregon.The scientist who first discovered the renegade grain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by dipping a plastic strip into a tube of pulped plant, in order to check its genetics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 believes the GM wheat could have entered America's food supply undetected years ago, and could still be in circulation.\"There's a lot of potential for how it could have got into the supply,\" said Carol Mallory-Smith, a professor of weed sciences at Oregon State University. \"It could have already been processed. It could have gone for animal feed somewhere or it could have gone for something else. It could have gone for storage.\"The Department of Agriculture, which is conducting a secretive investigation into the renegade GM wheat outbreak, maintains the GM wheat remained confined to a single 125-acre field on a single farm in eastern Oregon. Officials said there was no evidence the contaminated wheat was in the marketplace.Monsanto, which manufactured the altered gene and conducted field trials of the GM wheat several years ago, strongly suggested in a conference call with reporters on Friday that the company was the victim of sabotage of anti-GM campaigners. Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer, said: It's fair to say there are folks who don't like biotechnology and who would use this as an opportunity to make problems.The real story is unlikely to emerge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if at all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 until the publication of the final report by 18 Department of Agriculture investigators who are now scouring grain elevators, farmers' fields and university research stations in eastern Oregon, hunting for a few grains of suspicious wheat.The stakes are high for America's wheat exports, with Japan and South Korea cancelling shipments; for Monsanto, which faces lawsuits from farmers for falling wheat prices and a consumer backlash against GM products; and for the US government, which must shore up confidence in the safety and integrity of the food supply.The crisis for wheat farmers began in late April, with a phone call from a crop consultant seeking the advice of researchers at Oregon State University in Corvallis. The consultant had sprayed Roundup, a weed killer also manufactured by Monsanto, on some fallow land. Ordinarily, glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, would be expected to clean out the entire 125-acre field. This time, however, some plants survived.The consultant, fearing he had come across a \"superweed\", got in touch with the university and sent some plants in for testing. A clump of plants, carefully wrapped in plastic to keep them green, arrived by Fed-Ex on 30 April. Scientists separated 24 samples and tested them for the presence of Monsanto's Roundup Ready gene, CP4, which was developed to be resistant to glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup weed killer.\"They all came up positive,\" she said. So did a second battery of tests by another lab at the university and independent testing on a different set of wheat plants collected by researchers from the Department of Agriculture. The scientists were still slightly disbelieving, however. The only chance for contamination by the GM wheat, it was thought, was from field trials Monsanto conducted in the late 1990s until 2005.The wheat was grown in more than 100 test plots in 16 states over several years, but the company wound down the last of the trials in 2005, because it saw little market potential. Unlike the other big crops \u00e2\u0080\u0093 corn, soybeans, cotton and canola \u00e2\u0080\u0093 American farmers have never raised GM wheat on a commercial basis. The US exports much of its wheat to Asia and Europe, who do not want GM products. The Oregon field trials stopped in 2001.\"Our customers have zero-tolerance for GM wheat,\" said Wally Powell, president of the Oregon Wheat Growers League.Monsanto is currently testing a next generation of GM wheat in North Dakota and Hawaii. The company insists the seeds from those earlier trials were shipped backed to its labs in Missouri or destroyed in the field and driven deep into the earth with a backhoe.\"Most of the seed was destroyed in the field,\" said Jeff Koscelny, who heads Monsanto's wheat sales team. \"It never left the site, and it was buried. To us, it's not logical there were any seeds out there.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tMonsanto has faced a backlash over GM products. Photograph: Nigel Treblin/AFP/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nWhile Monsanto's chief technology officer suggested eco-activists were to blame, Mallory-Smith said deliberate contamination was the least likely scenario:The sabotage conspiracy theory is even harder for me to explain or think as logical because it would mean that someone had that seed and was holding that seed for 10 or 12 years and happened to put it on the right field to have it found, and identified. I don't think that makes a lot of sense.She was also sceptical of Monsanto's claims to have gathered up or destroyed every last seed from its earlier GM wheat trials. In recent years, as American farmers rely increasingly on GM crops, there have been a spate of such escapes, including rice, corn, soybean, and tomato. Oregon is still trying to contain a 2006 escape of GM bentgrass, used on golf courses, which has migrated 13 miles from where it was originally planted.\"Once we put a trait or a gene into the environment we can not expect that we are going to be able to retract or bring back that gene and find every last gene that we put out there,\" said Mallory-Smith. Tracing the course of an escape so long after Monsanto's field trials will be even more difficult, she said. \"It's like finding a needle in a hay stack,\" she said.One morning in late June, farmers from wheat-growing areas in Oregon, Idaho and Washington state drove their pick-up trucks to the station, to learn about the latest advances in farm technology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including toy-sized drones \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and to catch up on the latest on the GM wheat escape. Some of the farmers were relatively relaxed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those whose land sits relatively high up and don't expect to harvest their crop until August.Wheat prices reached historic highs before the GM discovery. If there is no further evidence of contamination, they figure they can ride out the crisis, store their wheat, and wait until Japan and South Korea place orders again. But there is also an undercurrent of suspicion and anger at the unidentified farmer who reported finding GM wheat on his land \u00e2\u0080\u0093 consequently putting all of their crops in jeopardy.\"It's a mystery to me how they even found that GM wheat,\" said Herb Marsh, 80, who has been farming in eastern Oregon his entire life. \"It's hard for me to swallow that he would go, and actually get it tested.\"It's just a big mystery,\" he said.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Company cries foul over appearance of genetically modified wheat plants but scientist who

Georgetown University", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/23/obama-climate-change#start-of-comments", "text": "\n\t    Barack Obama will unveil a national climate change plan on Tuesday, offering the first real glimpse of how he intends to make good on one of the most stirring promises of his inaugural address.In a video posted on the White House web site on Saturday, the US president reiterated his view that climate change was the challenge of a generation.The goals he will outline in his speech at Georgetown University will be equally ambitious, encompassing \"a national plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare our country for the impacts of climate change, and lead global efforts to fight it\", Obama said.There will likely be strong reactions from Republicans in Congress, who oppose action on climate change as  well as from fellow Democrats. Some campaigners will also doubtless argue Obama should do much more to stop global warming.In concrete terms, there is widespread expectation Obama will announce he is using his executive powers as president to direct federal government agencies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, and to encourage energy efficiency.He is also expected to step up government programmes promoting the expansion of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power especially on public land.The video also seemed to suggest that Obama would seek to involve his council of scientific advisors in drawing up a strategy for protecting American cities and coastlines from the worst consequences of climate change.Some of the policy elements in Obama's address were previewed earlier in the week in a speech by the White House climate advisor, Heather Zichal.In a forum sponsored by the New Republic magazine, Zichal suggested Obama would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.Coal-fired power plants are the single largest source of America's greenhouse gas emissions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 responsible for up to 40% of carbon pollution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and have long been a target of campaigners.The Obama administration has already taken steps to raising standards on new power plants. But it has balked until now at imposing tougher standards on existing power plants \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a measure which would deliver the biggest cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.There was intense speculation ahead of Tuesday's speech about whether Obama would promise to curb emissions of existing facilities.The president's comments in a speech in Berlin this week seemed to suggest he was prepared for bolder action.\"Our dangerous carbon emissions have come down, but we know we have to do more, and we will do more,\" Obama told the crowd.Zichal in her remarks this week also indicated EPA regulations would be part of Obama's climate plan.\"Going forward, obviously the EPA is going to be working very hard on rules that focus specifically on greenhouse gas emissions from the coal sector,\" she said. \"They're doing a lot of important work on that space.\"Tuesday's speech is likely to provoke strong reactions across the political spectrum.John Boehner, the house speaker, pre-empted the speech by several days, telling Fox news on Thursday it would be \"absolutely crazy\" to use the EPA to reduce carbon emissions.On the opposite end of the political divide, Obama will be under intense pressure on Tuesday to offer some assurances to opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline.The project, intended to carry tar sands crude from Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, has become a key issue for campaigners, who say it is a core test of Obama's environmental commitments.A number of prominent Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as well as 145 veterans of Obama's election campaigns \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have come out against the pipeline.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "US president will unveil blueprint for reducing carbon pollution in speech at

Chicago's Dave Bolland ended Boston's comeback hopes as they pressed for an equaliser and he scored into an empty net with 14 seconds to play. Chicago goalie Corey Crawford made 24 saves.Boston center Patrice Bergeron was taken to a Chicago hospital for observation after being injured during Game Five. The Bruins said on Twitter that there is \"no further update at this time.\"Colin Horgan's analysis will be online on Monday\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Stanley Cup Final: Chicago

cities and engaged police in isolated intense conflicts. Demonstrators vowed to stay in the streets until concrete steps are taken to reform the political system.Across Brazil protesters gathered to denounce legislation known as PEC 37 that would limit the power of federal prosecutors to investigate crimes. Many fear the laws would hinder attempts to jail corrupt politicians.Federal prosecutors were behind the investigation into the biggest corruption case in Brazil's history, the so-called \"mensal\u00c3\u00a3o\" cash-for-votes scheme that came to light in 2005 and involved top aides of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva buying off members of congress to vote for their legislation.Last year the supreme court condemned two dozen people in connection to the case, which was hailed as a watershed moment in Brazil's fight against corruption. However those condemned have yet to be jailed because of appeals, a delay that has enraged Brazilians.The protests continued despite a primetime speech the night before from President Dilma Rousseff, a former leftist guerrilla who was tortured during Brazil's military dictatorship. She tried to appease demonstrators by reiterating that peaceful protests were a welcome, democratic action and emphasising that she would not condone corruption in her government.\t\n\t\t        \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tfunction getOmnitureAccount_(){\n\t\t\treturn \"guardiangu-network\";\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tfunction getOmnitureData_() {\n\n\t\t\tvar omniture = new Object();\n\n\t\t\tomniture.prop43=\"Video\";\n\t\t\tomniture.prop44=\"Brazil protests: \\'we will lose a lot through violence\\', says president -:Video:1926386\";\n\t\t\tomniture.prop45=\"World news\";\n\n\t\t\tomniture.eVar43=\"Video\";\n\t\t\tomniture.eVar44=\"Brazil protests: \\'we will lose a lot through violence\\', says president -:Video:1926386\";\n\t\t\tomniture.eVar45=\"World news\";\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn omniture;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t\n    \n                        \n\n    \n        supports_local_storage = function () {\n            try {\n                return 'localStorage' in window && window.localStorage !== null;\n            } catch (e) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        };\n\n        mediaPreference = function (pref) {\n            if (pref === 'html' && checkGuardianCodecs()) {\n                localStorage.setItem(\"mediaPreference\", pref);\n                return \"You have set your audio/video preference to 'html'.

Nobody can take the corruption of this country any more.\"The wave of protests began as opposition to transportation fare hikes, then became a laundry list of causes including anger at high taxes, poor services and high World Cup spending, before coalescing around the issue of rampant government corruption. They have become the largest public demonstrations that Latin America's biggest nation has seen in two decades.Across Brazil police estimated that about 60,000 demonstrators gathered in a central square in the city of Belo Horizonte, 30,000 shut down a main business avenue in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo and another 30,000 gathered in the city in southern Brazil where a nightclub fire killed over 240 mostly university students, deaths many argued could have been avoided with better government oversight of fire laws. Tens of thousands more protested in more than 100 Brazilian cities, bringing the nationwide total to 250,000, according to a police count published on the website of O Globo TV, Brazil's largest television network.In Belo Horizonte police used teargas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who tried to pass through a barrier and hurled rocks at a car dealership. Salvador also saw protests turn violent.During her pre-recorded TV speech Rousseff promised that she would always battle corruption and that she would meet with peaceful protesters, governors and the mayors of big cities to create a national plan to improve urban transportation and use oil royalties for investments in education.Many Brazilians, shocked by a week of protests and violence, hoped that Rousseff's words after several days of silence from the leader would soothe tensions and help avoid more violence, but not all were convinced by her promises of action. Victoria Villela, a 21-year-old university student in the S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo protest, said she was \"frustrated and exhausted by the endless corruption of our government\".\"It was good Dilma spoke but this movement has moved too far, there was not much she could really say. All my friends were talking on Facebook about how she said nothing that satisfied them. I think the protests are going to continue for a long time and the crowds will still be huge.\"In the north-eastern city of Salvador, where Brazil's national football team played Italy and won 4-2 in a Confederations Cup match, about 5,000 protesters gathered three miles (5km) from the stadium, shouting demands for better schools and transportation and denouncing heavy spending on next year's World Cup.They blocked a main road and clashed with riot police who moved in to clear the street. Protesters said police used rubber bullets and tossed teargas canisters from a helicopter hovering overhead. The protesters scattered and fled to a nearby shopping mall, where they tried to take shelter in an underground parking garage.\"We sat down and the police came and asked us to free up one lane for traffic. As we were organising our group to do just that, the police lost their patience and began to shoot at us and throw [tear gas] canisters,\" said Rodrigo Dorado.That was exactly the type of conflict Rousseff said needed to end, not just so Brazilians could begin a peaceful national discussion about corruption but because much of the violence is taking place in cities hosting foreign tourists attending the Confederations Cup.Brazil's news media, which had blasted Rousseff in recent days for her lack of response to the protests, seemed largely unimpressed with her careful speech but noted the difficult situation facing a government trying to understand a mass movement with no central leaders and a flood of demands. With \"no objective information about the nature of the organisation of the protests\", wrote Igor Gielow in a column for Brazil's biggest newspaper, Folha de S Paulo, \"Dilma resorted to an innocuous speech to cool down spirits\".At the protests' height an estimated million anti-government demonstrators took to the streets nationwide on Thursday night with grievances ranging from public services to the billions of dollars spent preparing for international sports events.Outside the stadium in Belo Horizonte where Mexico and Japan met in a Confederations Cup game, Dadiana Gamaleliel, a 32-year-old physiotherapist, held up a banner that read: \"Not against the games, in favour of the nation.\"\"I am protesting on behalf of the whole nation because this must be a nation where people have a voice \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we don't have a voice any more,\" she said.She said Rousseff's speech would not change anything. \"She spoke in a general way and didn't say what she would do,\" Gamaleliel said. \"We will continue this until we are heard.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Anger as legislation that ties federal prosecutors' hands when investigating crime is

"description": "Having grown up in Santa Fe, actor Anna Gunn, best known as Skyler White in Breaking Bad, was thrilled to return to New Mexico to shoot the hit TV series. She gives us the lowdown on Santa Fe and Albuquerque\u2026", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/jun/22/breaking-bad-anna-gunn-santa-fe-albuquerque", "text": "\n\t    What kind of people are drawn to Santa Fe?There's a wide variety of people in Santa Fe. When we arrived in the late 70s it was before it had really been discovered, or written about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even as a travel destination. But it was a place people who were spiritual \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and artists \u00e2\u0080\u0093 knew of. I think it attracts those who want to connect with nature, and the city's incredible history.How much has growing up in Santa Fe moulded you as a person?There's so much art: visual, dance, theatre. All of a sudden, as a child, I was going to the opera for the first time in my life. This was back when the opera house was somewhat uncovered so you'd be watching the Magic Flute and the backdrop would be the mountains, the sky and you'd be sitting out under the stars hearing the most beautiful music. As an eight-year-old, that changes your life. I'm certain it steered me in the career direction I eventually chose.Since Breaking Bad, has Albuquerque had more visitors?Absolutely. There's actually now an unofficial tour, which is extraordinary. People make a day of it. When we were shooting at the car wash or the white house, the lovely people who own the white house, Fran and Louis, would tell us how people now knock on their door from all over the world. Sometimes they want to know if the pizza that Walt threw onto the roof is still up there.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tDesert destination. The New Mexico location for the 'cooking in the RV' scenes of Breaking Bad is a draw for fans. Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex\n\t\t\t\n            \nWhat is the best location to visit?All the places we filmed at are normal, everyday locations. Saul's office was just a storefront in the mini-mall. The art department put up that funny statue in front of it, so it doesn't even look that way. The most exciting thing would be the desert \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when they cooked out there in the RV. Although that would be a little harder to find, because it's in the middle of nowhere, I imagine people still try to find it. The train heist episode, which is\u00a0one of the newer ones, would be a really exciting location to check out. That's up close to Santa Fe, near Lamy, I believe.Has Breaking Bad changed the way you view the area?I think the way Michael Slovis, the art director, captured New Mexico was extraordinary. New Mexico becomes a character in the show and I can't imagine it being set anywhere else. He had this vision of it being like a Sergio Leone film and I think that really comes across, especially as Walt gets deeper into the crime and that old western feel develops.What is the best thing a visitor can experience in Albuquerque?    \n                \n\t\t\t\tAlbuquerque's hot air balloon fiesta. Photograph: Kevin Fleming/Corbis\n\t\t\t\n            \nThe balloon fiesta every October is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. There are hundreds of hot air balloons in all shapes and sizes. They try their best to land back in the park, but sometimes they land in people's backyards. One day I was doing the dishes and one landed outside my window.Where can you go to get a taste of Santa Fe?There's a restaurant called Cafe Pasqual's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 my brother worked there as a dishwasher when he was a kid. They have a big community table and they do this breakfast burrito, which, if you manage to eat it, will mean you're set for the day. If you want authentic Santa Fe food, go to the Five and Dime General Store on the Santa Fe Plaza where they sell amazing frito pies (chilli, cheese and corn chips). I used to have them as a kid and they still serve them.The soundtrack to Breaking Bad has received a lot of praise. Is there a particular song that reminds you of New Mexico?De Colores. I'm not sure if they used it in Breaking Bad but, whenever I\u00a0hear it, it reminds me of Santa Fe. It's a really traditional Mexican song you hear all the time.

co-wrote a libellous leaflet that was highly critical of McDonald's, and which led to the longest civil trial in English history, costing the fast-food chain millions of pounds in fees.The true identity of one of the authors of the \"McLibel leaflet\" is Bob Lambert, a police officer who used the alias Bob Robinson in his five years infiltrating the London Greenpeace group, is revealed in a new book about undercover policing of protest, published next week.McDonald's famously sued green campaigners over the roughly typed leaflet, in a landmark three-year high court case, that was widely believed to have been a public relations disaster for the corporation. Ultimately the company won a libel battle in which it spent millions on lawyers.Lambert was deployed by the special demonstration squad (SDS) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a top-secret Metropolitan police unit that targeted political activists between 1968 until 2008, when it was disbanded. He co-wrote the defamatory six-page leaflet in 1986 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and his role in its production has been the subject of an internal Scotland Yard investigation for several months.At no stage during the civil legal proceedings brought by McDonald's in the 1990s was it disclosed that a police infiltrator helped author the leaflet.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tThe McLibel two: Helen Steel and David Morris, outside a branch of McDonald's in London in 2005 after winning their case in the European court of human rights. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian\n\t\t\t\n            \nA spokesman for the Met said the force \"recognises the seriousness of the allegations of inappropriate behaviour and practices involving past undercover deployments\". He added that a number of allegations surrounding the undercover officers were currently being investigated by a team overseen by the chief constable of Derbyshire police, Mick Creedon.And in remarks that come closest to acknowledging the scale of the scandal surrounding police spies, the spokesman said: \"At some point it will fall upon this generation of police leaders to account for the activities of our predecessors, but for the moment we must focus on getting to the truth.\"Lambert declined to comment about his role in the production of the McLibel leaflet. However, he previously offered a general apology for deceiving \"law abiding members of London Greenpeace\", which he said was a peaceful campaign group.Lambert, who rose through the ranks to become a spymaster in the SDS, is also under investigation for sexual relationships he had with four women while undercover, one of whom he fathered a child with before vanishing from their lives. The woman and her son only discovered that Lambert was a police spy last year.The internal police inquiry is also investigating claims raised in parliament that Lambert ignited an incendiary device at a branch of Debenhams when infiltrating animal rights campaigners. The incident occurred in 1987 and the explosion inflicted \u00c2\u00a3300,000 worth of damage to the branch in Harrow, north London. Lambert has previously strongly denied he planted the incendiary device in the Debenhams store.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tWhile McDonald's won the initial legal battle, at great expense, it was seen as a PR disaster. Photograph: Image Broker/Rex Features\n\t\t\t\n            \nLambert's role in helping compose the McLibel leaflet is revealed in 'Undercover: The True Story of Britain's Secret Police', which is published next week. An extract from the book will be published in the Guardian Weekend magazine. A joint Guardian/Channel 4 investigation into undercover policing will be broadcast on Dispatches on Monday evening.Lambert was one of two SDS officers who infiltrated London Greenpeace; the second, John Dines, had a two-year relationship with Helen Steel, who later became the co-defendant in the McLibel case. The book reveals how Steel became the focus of police surveillance operations. She had a sexual relationship with Dines, before he also disappeared without a trace.Dines gained access to the confidential legal advice given to Steel and her co-defendant that was written by Keir Starmer, then a barrister known for championing radical causes. The lawyer was advising the activists on how to defend themselves against McDonald's. He is now the director of public prosecutions in England and Wales.Lambert was lauded by colleagues in the covert unit for his skilful infiltration of animal rights campaigners and environmentalists in the 1980s. He succeeded in transforming himself from a special branch detective into a long-haired radical activist who worked as a cash-in-hand gardener. He became a prominent member of London Greenpeace, around the time it began campaigning against McDonald's in 1985. The leaflet he helped write made wide-ranging criticisms of the company, accusing it of destroying the environment, exploiting workers and selling junk food.Four sources who were either close to Lambert at the time, or involved in the production of the leaflet, have confirmed his role in composing the libellous text. Lambert confided in one of his girlfriends from the era, although he appeared keen to keep his participation hidden. \"He did not want people to know he had co-written it,\" Belinda Harvey said.Paul Gravett, a London Greenpeace campaigner, said the spy was one of a small group of around five activists who drew up the leaflet over several months. Another close friend from the time recalls Lambert was really proud of the leaflet. \"It was like his baby, he carried it around with him,\" the friend said.When Lambert's undercover deployment ended in 1989, he vanished, claiming that he had to flee abroad because he was being pursued by special branch. None of his friends or girlfriends suspected that special branch was his employer.It was only later that the leaflet Lambert helped to produce became the centre of the huge trial. Even though the activists could only afford to distribute a few hundred copies of the leaflet, McDonald's decided to throw all of its legal might at the case, suing two London Greenpeace activists for libel.Two campaigners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Steel, who was then a part-time bartender, and an unemployed postal worker, Dave Morris \u00e2\u0080\u0093 unexpectedly stood their ground and refused to apologise.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tSteel and Morris outside the high court at the start of the first proceedings in the McLibel trial in 1990. Photograph: Photofusion/UIG/ Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nOver 313 days in the high court, the pair defended themselves, with pro bono assistance from Starmer, as they could not afford to hire any solicitors or barristers. In contrast, McDonald's hired some of the best legal minds at an estimated cost of \u00c2\u00a310m. During the trial, legal argument largely ignored the question of who wrote the McLibel leaflet, focusing instead on its distribution to members of the public.In 1997, a high court judge ruled that much of the leaflet was libellous and ordered the two activists to pay McDonald's \u00c2\u00a360,000 in damages. This sum was reduced on appeal to \u00c2\u00a340,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but McDonald's never enforced payment.It was a hollow victory for the company; the long-running trial had exposed damaging stories about its business and the quality of the food it was selling to millions of customers around the world. The legal action, taking advantage of Britain's much-criticised libel laws, was seen as a heavy handed and intimidating way of crushing criticism. However, the role of undercover police in the story remained, until now, largely unknown.On Friday, Morris said the campaign against the burger chain was successful \"despite the odds overwhelmingly stacked against us in the legal system and up against McDonald's massive and relentless advertising and propaganda machine.\"We now know that other shadowy forces were also trying to undermine our efforts in the most disgusting, but ultimately futile ways. All over the world police and secret agents infiltrate opposition movements in order to protect the rich and powerful but as we have seen in so many countries recently people power and the pursuit of truth and justice is unstoppable, even faced with the most repressive and unacceptable Stasi-like tactics.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Exclusive: McDonald's sued green activists

  The blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng is due to arrive in Taiwan on Sunday, a week after he suggested New York University was forcing him to leave because of pressure from Beijing.Chen's trip to address the Taiwanese parliament and speak at universities was overshadowed when a row broke out about the end of his tenure at NYU, where in 2012 he took up a one-year fellowship that allowed him to leave China. Chen has written that soon after his arrival NYU began to come under \"great, unrelenting pressure\" from Chinese communists in US academia to force him out. Bizarre claims then emerged that supposed supporters of Chen had given him a phone and iPad loaded with spyware and tracking capabilities when he started at NYU.  The heads of NYU strenuously denied they were bowing to pressure because they want to open a campus in Shanghai and said the deal for the university to host Chen had simply come to an end.Chen sparked a diplomatic crisis between China and the United States in 2012 when he fled to the US embassy in Beijing from house arrest. Since then he has been a special student at NYU's US-Asia Law Institute while working on a book due out this year.Chen's trip to Taiwan was part of his efforts to enhance freedoms and human rights for his fellow Chinese, said the tour's organiser, the Taiwan Association for China Human Rights.Chen's Taiwan visit offers a challenge for the country's president, Ma Ying-jeou, who has built his administration around better relations with China, from which Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949.China claims Taiwan as its territory and resents any Taiwanese activity that embarrasses Beijing. The island is a democracy but Ma is also trying to improve relations with the Communist party government on the mainland.In May, the Chinese government in effect warned Chen to mind his language when he visits Taiwan. \"As a Chinese citizen, on his activities overseas he should know how to protect the country's dignity and fulfil his responsibilities as a citizen,\" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei.The Taiwanese presidential office said Ma had not scheduled a meeting with Chen.In Taiwan Chen is scheduled to give a news conference, address the island's legislature, meet the parliamentary Speaker, Wang Jin-pyng, and speak at universities.Chen escaped house arrest in his rural town in eastern China's Shandong province in April 2012. Chinese officials later let him move to the US with his wife and children in an arrangement negotiated with the United States.He had angered local Chinese officials by documenting complaints about forced abortions. A self-taught lawyer, Chen has criticised China's human rights records, speaking about it before a US congressional committee.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Blind activist in

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/23/edward-snowden-leaves-hong-kong-moscow", "text": "\n\t    The NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has flown out of Hong Kong, where he had been in hiding since identifying himself as the source of revelations on US surveillance programmes, despite a US request for his arrest.The 30-year-old had previously said he would stay in the city and fight for his freedom in the courts. But the Hong Kong government confirmed that he left on Sunday, two days after the US announced it had charged him with espionage, saying documents filed by the US did not fully comply with legal requirements.It also said it was requesting clarification from Washington on Snowden's claims that the US had hacked targets in the territory.Snowden had been at a safe house since 10 June, when he checked out of his hotel after giving an interview to the Guardian outing himself as the source who leaked top secret documents.Hong Kong's decision to allow him to leave comes a day after the US sought to turn up the pressure on the territory to hand him over, with a senior administration official telling the Washington Post: \"If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law.\"Sunday's statement from the Hong Kong authorities said: \"Mr Edward Snowden left Hong Kong today [June 23] of his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel.\"The US government earlier on made a request to the HKSAR [Hong Kong special administrative region] government for the issue of a provisional warrant of arrest against Mr Snowden. Since the documents provided by the US government did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law, the HKSAR government has requested the US government to provide additional information so that the Department of Justice could consider whether the US government's request can meet the relevant legal conditions.\"As the HKSAR government has yet to have sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr Snowden from leaving Hong Kong.\"The HKSAR government has already informed the US government of Mr Snowden's departure.\"Meanwhile, the HKSAR government has formally written to the US government requesting clarification on earlier reports about the hacking of computer systems in Hong Kong by US government agencies. The HKSAR government will continue to follow up on the matter so as to protect the legal rights of the people of Hong Kong.\"According to the South China Morning Post, Snowden boarded an Aeroflot flight to Moscow, although the newspaper said Russia was not his ultimate destination. It suggested he might go to Ecuador or Iceland \u00e2\u0080\u0093 having cited the latter as a possible refuge in an interview with the Guardian.However, reports from Moscow indicate that Havana would be his next port of call, with the ultimate destination either Caracas in Venezuela or Quito in Ecuador.The South China Morning Post claimed he took off from the airport at 10.55am on flight SU213 on Sunday morning and was due to arrive at Moscow's Shermetyevo International Airport at 5.15pm [local times].It said the Russian embassy in Beijing would neither confirm nor deny he was on a flight to Moscow and the Russian consulate in Hong Kong declined to comment.Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin, said: \"I don't [know if he's planning to stay in Moscow]. I heard about the potential [arrival] from the press. I know nothing.\"On whether Moscow would still consider a request for asylum from Snowden: \"Every application is considered so it's standard procedure \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We are not tracing his movements and I know nothing.\"US authorities could not be reached for comment.WikiLeaks tweeted to say that it had \"assisted Mr Snowden's political asylum in a democratic country, travel papers and safe exit from Hong Kong\".On Friday, an Icelandic businessman linked to WikiLeaks told Reuters he had prepared a private plane for Snowden's use if the government was willing to give him asylum.\"A private jet is in place in China and we could fly Snowden over tomorrow if we get positive reaction from the interior ministry. We need to get confirmation of asylum and that he will not be extradited to the US. We would most want him to get a citizenship as well,\" said Olafur Vignir Sigurvinsson, a director of DataCell, which processed payments for WikiLeaks.The Icelandic government has declined to say whether it would grant asylum to Snowden and pointed out that he would need to apply in person.Snowden has said he did not travel direct to Iceland from the US because he feared the small country could be put under pressure by Washington.Lawyers have said the legal battle for Snowden's surrender could last for years, particularly if he argued that he should not be returned because his offence was political. But they had also warned that in the long run he was unlikely to prove successful.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "NSA whistleblower left on Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Hong Kong

address\n\t\t\n\tBarack Obama made a fresh push for comprehensive immigration reform on Saturday, calling for the public to back a Senate bill which he claimed will save the country money in the long term.\"Reach out to your senators and representatives. Tell them that the time for excuses is over. It's time to fix our broken immigration system once and for all,\" the president said in his weekly address, on whitehouse.gov.The bipartisan bill aims to improve border security, attract more highly-skilled workers by changing the visa system, crack down on the hiring of undocumented workers and provide a path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.Obama cited a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimated last Tuesday that the bill would decrease federal budget deficits by nearly $200bn between 2014 and 2023 and by an extra $700bn in the following decade.\"According to this independent report, reforming our immigration system would reduce our deficits by almost a trillion dollars over the next two decades. And it will boost our economy by more than 5%, in part because of businesses created, investments made, and technologies invented by immigrants,\" he said.However, the report's figures drew sceptical comments from Republicans. The CBO also estimated that under the bill \"the net annual flow of unauthorised residents would decrease by about 25% relative to what would occur under current law\". That is not a big enough reduction for conservatives seeking much tighter border control as part of the reforms.Obama said: \"The bill isn't perfect. It's a compromise. Nobody is going to get everything they want, not Democrats, not Republicans, not me.\"The bill was given new impetus on Thursday after an amendment was proposed by two Republican senators, to almost double the number of border patrol agents to 40,000, add fencing and increase the use of surveillance technology. There are already twice as many border patrol agents as there were in 2004, but the amendment may prove palatable to conservatives.The Senate could hold its first vote on the plans on Monday.\n    ",

urgent military support to Western-backed rebels, aiming to stem a counter-offensive by Assad's forces and offset the growing power of jihadist fighters. Assad's recapture of the strategic border town of Qusair, an effort spearheaded by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, and an expected assault on the divided northern city of Aleppo have alarmed supporters of the Syrian opposition. The US administration has responded by saying, for the first time, it will arm rebels, while Gulf sources say Saudi Arabia has accelerated the delivery of advanced weapons to the rebels over the last week. Ministers from the 11 core members of the Friends of Syria group agreed \"to provide urgently all the necessary materiel and equipment to the opposition on the ground,\" according to a statement released at the end of their meeting in Qatar. The statement did not commit all the countries to send weapons, but said each country could provide assistance \"in its own way, in order to enable [the rebels] to counter brutal attacks by the regime and its allies\". The aid should be channelled through the Western-backed Supreme Military Council, a move that Washington and its European allies hope will prevent weapons falling into the hands of Islamist radicals including the al-Qaida-linked Nusra front. Ministers from the Friends group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which includes Western and Arab states as well as Turkey \u00e2\u0080\u0093 also condemned \"the intervention of Hezbollah militias and fighters from Iran and Iraq\", demanding they withdraw immediately. As well as fighting in Qusair, Hezbollah is deployed alongside Iraqi gunmen around the Shia shrine of Sayyida Zainab, south of Damascus. Iranian military commanders are believed to be advising Assad's officers on counter-insurgency. Two Gulf sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia, which started supplying anti-aircraft missiles to the rebels on a small scale two months ago, had accelerated delivery of sophisticated weaponry. \"In the past week there have been more arrivals of these advanced weapons. They are getting them more frequently,\" one source said, without giving details. Another Gulf source described them as \"potentially balance-tipping\" supplies. French military advisers are training the rebels in Turkey and Jordan, sources familiar with the training programmes said. US forces have been carrying out similar training, rebels say. Rebel fighters say they need anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons to stem the fightback by Assad's forces in a civil war that has killed 93,000 people, driven 1.6 million refugees abroad and cost tens of billions of dollars in destruction of property, businesses and infrastructure.Louay Meqdad, spokesman for the Supreme Military Council, which is led by former Syrian army general Salim Idriss, said it had received several batches of weapons. \"They are the first consignments from one of the countries that support the Syrian people and there are clear promises from Arab and foreign countries that there will be more during the coming days,\" he told Reuters Television in Istanbul.     \n                \n\t\t\t\tUS Secretary of State John Kerry and Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, after a ministerial meeting on Syria, in Doha, Qatar. Photograph: Str/EPA\n\t\t\t\n            \nA French diplomatic source said Paris would increase non-lethal aid such as communications equipment, gas masks, night-vision goggles and bullet-proof vests. It would also provide assistance with military strategy and battlefield intelligence. \"All this has already started,\" a Western source said. \"Broadly speaking, Western nations will do this, while Gulf Arab nations will deliver the weapons. It's a division of roles. If the northern front receives enough material and non-material support quickly, it could soon be equivalent to thousands of men, or even tens of thousands.\" Idriss himself told Al-Jazeera International television on Saturday that his men were still lacking \"effective air defence\" against Assad's planes and helicopters. \"That's why we are asking for shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and anti-tank missiles, modern ones with long range,\" he said. \"We need it yesterday \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 because the regime is trying to recapture the whole country.\" The increasingly sectarian dynamic of the war pits mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against forces loyal to Assad \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who is from the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and has split the Middle East along Sunni-Shia lines. US secretary of state John Kerry said Hezbollah's role transformed the conflict \"into a much more volatile, potentially explosive situation that could involve the entire region\".\n    ", "og:type":

even briefly from their personal electronic devices, as the Federal Aviation Administration moves towards allowing gate-to-gate use of music players, tablets, laptops, smartphones and other gadgets.Restrictions on cellphone calls and internet use and transmission are not expected to be changed.An industry-labor advisory committee was supposed to make recommendations next month to the FAA on easing restrictions on using electronic devices during takeoffs and landings. But the agency said in a statement on Friday that the deadline has been extended to September, because committee members asked for extra time to finish assessing whether it's safe to lift restrictions.\"The FAA recognizes consumers are intensely interested in the use of personal electronics aboard aircraft; that is why we tasked a government-industry group to examine the safety issues and the feasibility of changing the current restrictions,\" the statement said.The agency is under public and political pressure to ease the restrictions as more people bring their devices with them when they fly, in order to read e-books, listen to music, watch videos and get work done. Technically, the FAA doesn't bar use of electronic devices when aircraft are below 10,000ft. But under FAA rules, airlines that want to let passengers use the devices are faced with a practical impossibility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they would have to show that they have tested every type and make of device passengers would use, to ensure there is no electromagnetic interference with aircraft radios and electrical and electronic systems.As a result, US airlines simply bar all electric device use below 10,000ft. Airline accidents are most likely to occur during takeoffs, landings and taxiing.Using cellphones to make calls on planes is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. There is concern that making calls from fast-flying planes might strain cellular systems, interfering with service on the ground. There is also the potential annoyance factor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether passengers will be unhappy if they have to listen to other passengers yakking on the phone.Although the restrictions have been broadly criticized as unnecessary, committee members saw value in them. One of the considerations being weighed is whether some heavier devices like laptops should continue to be restricted because they might become dangerous projectiles, hurting other passengers during a crash, the committee member said. There is less concern about tablets and other lighter devices.\"It's good to see the FAA may be on the verge of acknowledging what the traveling public has suspected for years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that current rules are arbitrary and lack real justification,\" said Senator Claire McCaskill, one of Congress' more outspoken critics of the restrictions, in a statement. She contends that unless scientific evidence can be presented to justify the restrictions, they should be lifted.Edward Pizzarello, the co-founder of the frequent-flier discussion site MilePoint, said lifting the restriction was \"long overdue.\"\"I actually feel like this regulation has been toughest on flight attendants. Nobody wants to shut off their phone, and the flight attendants are always left to be the bad guys and gals,\" said Pizzarello.Actor Alec Baldwin became the face of passenger frustration with the restrictions in 2011, when he was kicked off a New York-bound flight from Los Angeles for refusing to turn off his cellphone. Baldwin later issued an apology to fellow American Airlines passengers who were delayed, but mocked the flight attendant on Twitter.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Use of music

than two decades because he was considered a communist and a sympathiser of Cuba's Fidel Castro, recently released documents show.The documents posted on the FBI's website show the US denied Fuentes an entry visa at least twice in the 1960s. In one of the memoranda Fuentes is described as \"a leading Mexican communist writer\" and a \"well-known Mexican novelist with long history of subversive connections\".Fuentes died in 2012 at age 83 after suffering an internal haemorrhage.In the 170-page dossier of internal official documents and some newspaper articles, the FBI describes how it monitored Fuentes and denied him permission to enter the US for having been a member of the Mexican Communist party.One of the 20th century's most influential Latin American authors and intellectuals, Fuentes backed Castro after he took over Cuba and supported the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua. But Fuentes' good relations with the Cuban government ended in 1971 when he joined protests over its treatment of poet the Heberto Padilla, something Cuban officials never forgave him for.The first documents date from 1962 when Fuentes received an invitation to go to the US for a televised debate with the then secretary of state, Richard Goodwin. A note dated 3 April 1962 states that until that day Fuentes had not requested a visa at the US embassy in Mexico and adds that there were instructions from Washington to delay his application and await further instructions.The FBI's file for Fuentes includes newspaper articles about how his visa application was later denied.Although Fuentes was denied an entry visa more than once, the Mexican writer did make several visits to the US and was granted permission to teach at American universities. But authorities continued to track him in US territory.In a memorandum from October 1970 addressed to the FBI's director, the bureau suggests finding sources and informants at Columbia and New York University who could monitor Fuentes. The memo warns against an active investigation because of media attention.\"Because of Fuentes' prominence as an author, the publicity which has attended his prior visa refusals and his indicated connection with two New York City universities, no active investigation regarding him is desired at this time,\" the document reads.It ends with a note stating that Fuentes has a \"long history of subversive connections and has traveled to the Iron Curtain and Cuba\".Once considered a communist, Fuentes spent some of his childhood in the US as the son of a Mexican diplomat. He said it grated on him that his left-of-centre politics meant he often was portrayed as anti-American. \"To call me anti-American is a stupendous lie, a calumny. I grew up in this country. When I was a little boy I shook the hand of Franklin Roosevelt and I haven't washed it since,\" he said with characteristic good humor in a 2006 interview in Los Angeles.More recently, as a moderate leftist, Fuentes strongly opposed US tactics in the crackdown on immigration as part of the war on terrorism. But he also blasted Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00c3\u00a1vez as a \"Tropical Mussolini\".The FBI files show how over time the bureau changed its views about Fuentes. Early on the FBI highlighted his leftist tendencies but in 1985 he is described as a prominent author and is given a visa to teach at Harvard.In Fuentes' application US authorities say that even though he had been deemed ineligible for an entry permit for being a member of a banned organisation in the early 1960s, an apparent reference to the Mexican Communist party, he should be given a visa to go to Harvard because he is an \"outstanding 20th century Mexican author\".The FBI released the documents after NYCity News Service filed a request in September 2012 for Fuentes' FBI file under freedom of information, which requires the agency to release certain documents to the public once a person has died.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Acclaimed Mexican author and

health secretary and Tory successor rebut claims as Cumbrian MP calls for immediate inquiry", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jun/23/burnham-lansley-cqc-row", "text": "\n\t    Two former health secretaries have been drawn into the row over how health watchdogs failed to properly investigate the deaths of up to 16 babies and two mothers at an NHS trust.Labour's Andy Burnham denied putting pressure on the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to play down safety concerns, and Andrew Lansley, the Conservative who succeeded him, denied claims by the CQC whistleblower Kay Sheldon that appeals to the government about poor standards at the commission were dismissed.Sheldon said she had been left to be \"bullied, isolated and victimised\" for her attempts to reveal shortcomings at the commission, where she is still a board member.As the furore over the Morecambe Bay trust in Cumbria showed no sign of abating, a local MP called for an independent inquiry set up by the NHS into events at the trust to start immediately.Labour's John Woodock, whose Barrow and Furness constituency contains Furness general hospital, part of the trust, said: \"The latest evidence on the CQC cover-up show why the stalled independent inquiry into failings at Morecambe Bay should begin right now and be widened to include the CQC cover-up in March last year.\"The Grant Thornton report last week made clear it had not found any evidence of political pressure being applied during the flawed registration process in 2010 but the authors did believe that apparent suppression of a damning internal review in March last year 'may constitute a broader and ongoing cover-up'.\"The more questions that are raised about this murky business, the more important it becomes to investigate it further \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including who outside the CQC was aware and what they did.\"The Sunday Telegraph said it had seen documents suggesting, it alleged, that Labour put pressure on the CQC before the 2010 election to restore public confidence in the NHS.Roger Davidson, former head of media and public affairs for the CQC, was reportedly forced out of his job just before the election after revealing how a quarter of NHS trusts failed to meet basic hygiene standards. The newspaper said he was forced to sign a gagging order when he left and was told that the CQC was \"railing against\" his action to \"highlight issues\".David Morris, the Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lonsdale, asked Burnham in an open letter how much pressure he had put on the CQC to tone down criticism of hospitals.Burnham told Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News: \"I never said to the CQC: 'Don't say that, do say the other.' That wasn't my role, they were an independent regulator.\"The central allegation that I was kind of in that period trying to say don't do anything, don't say anything, don't bring any problems out, keep them all hidden, is fundamentally disproved by the decisions I took in relation to the expediting the registration of hospitals.\"Burnham said the \"cover-up\" over Morecambe Bay \"happened on this government's watch, not on our watch\". He added: \"I do think you need to be putting some of these questions to the current government. We know that the whistleblower went to the last secretary of state with concerns. What action was taken on those concerns?\"Sheldon, the whistleblower who gave evidence at the public inquiry into a separate scandal at the Mid-Staffordshire trust, criticised the health department's attitude under Lansley.She said in the Mail on Sunday: \"I was asked by the Department of Health to stop going to board meetings, and I discovered that chairman Dame Jo Williams had written to then health secretary Andrew Lansley asking him to remove me from my position.\"When I persisted on going to board meetings, other colleagues closed ranks and would speak to me only when they absolutely had to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the atmosphere was horrendous. I then discovered that Jo Williams had commissioned a mental health report on me and even made a doctor's appointment for me behind my back. She later resigned over this.\"Lansley told Sky News: \"I didn't dismiss Kay Sheldon from the CQC board and did give her access to whistleblower status.\" He refused to comment on Burnham's comments, saying he had not seen the interview. \"I think the last thing the people at Morecambe Bay trust or who need confidence rebuilding in the NHS \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the last thing they want to see is a political ding-dong about this,\" he said.Lansley said the coalition had taken substantial steps to turn around the CQC and help Morecambe Bay trust. The health department said in a statement that Lansley had ordered a review to establish the facts about how Sheldon's \"raising of concerns about the CQC were handled, taking into account all perspectives\".The commission said: \"'We have acknowledged that a dysfunctional relationship between the board and the executive contributed to some of Kay Sheldon's concerns not being considered as they should have. Poor relationships led to a breakdown of trust, which is why CQC has taken steps to strengthen both the board and the executive team.\"CQC chair David Prior publicly thanked Kay Sheldon at the public board meeting. This symbolises the different approach taken by the board and the new executive team.\"The health service ombudsman has confirmed that it was looking into the behaviour of the now-abolished NHS North West strategic health authority at the time of the failings at Furness general hospital, but would not comment on the details of its investigations. Mike Farrar, now chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing trusts, formerly led NHS North West.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Labour former health secretary and Tory

about her family life, Amy Winehouse's brother Alex talks in his first major interview about the girl who became a superstar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and reveals what he thinks really killed her. Elizabeth\u2026", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jun/23/amy-winehouse-growing-up-sister", "text": "\n\t    A few months ago, almost two years after his sister Amy's death at the age of 27, Alex Winehouse was sorting through her possessions and came across a child-size navy blue jumper. The jumper turned out to be part of Amy's old school uniform from Osidge  Primary School in Southgate, north London that, unbeknown to her family, she had stowed away carefully for years.\"I couldn't believe she had that,\" Alex says now, sitting in a sun-streamed room, one leg resting across the other and leaning back in his chair. This is his first ever full-length interview, given to mark the opening of a major new exhibition at the Jewish Museum entitled Amy Winehouse: a Family Portrait. The school jumper, Alex says, is his favourite exhibit.\"I think it shows that it doesn't matter what happens in life, how famous you become, regardless of who you are, you're always from somewhere,\" he explains. \"No matter what you do, you can't forget that because it makes you who you are. And she never forgot. It was very reassuring to see that for me.\"There is a photograph of the two Winehouse siblings from that time. It shows Alex, the elder by four years, with a protective arm around his little sister's shoulders. Amy, not yet 10, has her chin cocked towards  the camera, displaying even then a defiant kind of confidence.To the outside world, the name Amy Winehouse went on to become synonymous with both talent and tragedy. She lived her life out in the full glare of the public spotlight and then she died in July 2011 after an alcohol binge, three years shy of her 30th birthday. She was renowned for her husky contralto vocals and her ability to fuse the classic melodies of soul, jazz and R&B, making them relevant to a modern audience. In her short career, she won many awards, including a Brit, three Novellos and six Grammys. Her second album, Back to Black, is currently the UK's best-selling album of the 21st century.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tAmy in stripy sweatshirt at home as a youngster. Photograph: Winehouse Foundation\n\t\t\t\n            \nIn style terms, too, Winehouse redefined what we came to expect of a pop star. Instead of being primped and packaged as a teen-market popstrel, she had a towering beehive, heavy eyeliner and a fondness for leopard-print and tattoos. Karl Lagerfeld claimed her as his new muse in 2007 and sent beehived models down the Chanel catwalk; French Vogue dedicated a whole fashion story  to her look and hundreds of girls bought a version of her style on the  high street.But there was, of course, a darker side to Amy Winehouse: a trail of disturbing media stories and paparazzo images tracked her painful disintegration. Photos appeared of her on London streets, tear-stained and with bleeding feet, or with badly bruised legs. The lattice of scars on her arms from a period of self-harm and cutting in her teens were often visible. Her drink and drug abuse was well-documented. In 2008, a tabloid newspaper published a video that appeared to show her smoking crack cocaine. Over the years, she was in and out of rehab.For much of HER LIFE, it seemed as if we knew everything about her. But the exhibition will reveal a\u00a0different, more intimate side. And for Alex Winehouse, she will always just be his little sister, which is why that school jumper meant so much to him. It was a reminder  of what she had been, before the madness  spiralled out of control, before the world claimed her as a\u00a0celebrity and her addictions destroyed her.\"Do you have a sister?\" he asks me when I\u00a0wonder what Amy was like. I nod. \"Then you'll know. She was annoying, frustrating, a\u00a0pain in the bum. But she was also incredibly generous, very caring. She'd do anything for anyone, she really would. She was loyal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as a sister, daughter and friend. She was probably the most loyal friend to people I've ever known.\" Later, he adds: \"She was a really good person. And horrible in other respects.\"The exhibition will include several of her personal effects and items of clothing and will also trace the Winehouse ancestry back generations to those who emigrated to London from Russia and Poland in the late 19th century.The aim, says Alex, is to portray his sister \"as a normal person and us as a normal family\" and to show how Amy was influenced by an ingrained Jewish identity. Their parents, Mitch and Janis, who divorced when Alex was 13 and Amy was nine, brought them up with an appreciation of the faith's rituals and rites of passage. As adults, neither of the siblings was particularly religious, but they felt culturally Jewish \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Amy was famously meant to have cooked chicken soup for her bodyguards.\"She made it once for me,\" says Alex, screwing up his face in distaste. \"It  was awful.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\t'We took different paths': a portrait of Alex Winehouse with Amy's guitar. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer\n\t\t\t\n            \nIs there a part of him that sees the exhibition as a means of reclaiming the sister he knew, rather than the pop star fame created?\"I don't think you can,\" Alex says after a\u00a0moment's thought. \"I don't think that's possible. I'm not really fussed about how she's perceived because I know the truth\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That's more important than what people think.\"Alex Winehouse has never before spoken publicly in depth about his sister. At the height of her fame and throughout the shambolic latter years of her life, he stayed under the radar. He says he wanted to be a refuge for her from the strangeness of her celebrity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he describes  visiting Amy occasionally at her Camden flat and seeing banks of photographers camped outside.\"She was pretty much shut in the house and couldn't go anywhere,\" he remembers. \"I'd go home, back to normality. She didn't have that. The interest that they had in her was  absolutely insane. She didn't want it but her every moment was covered in the press.\"Part of him, too, feels that his recollections of Amy are \"no one's business, because there's a lot of dramas associated with her and that still goes on. If I'm going to speak, it's because I\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 or we, the foundation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are doing something really, really cool. I'm not going to talk for the sake of talking.\"The Amy Winehouse Foundation, set up by her family in the wake of her death, works to prevent the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on young people. A schools programme launched in March by the foundation has already made substantial donations to various charities. Alex, who gave up his job as an online music journalist to work full-time for the foundation with his father, a former black-cab driver, says the experience has brought the family closer together. In the aftermath of Amy's death, Alex explains, \"Dad had two choices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he could either let it destroy him, or use Amy's memory to invigorate himself to do something good.\"But after so many years not talking, there is a part of Alex that finds it difficult to change the habit. He chooses his words carefully and seems determined not to show too much  emotion. He prefers humour to introspection. When he talks about going to hospital when Amy was born in 1983 and being given his baby sister to hold, he says: \"She smelled and I didn't like it. She stank. It was that milky, newborn smell and I just thought, 'I don't like the smell, I don't like you. Why are you in my house?'\"He laughs. Did it get better after that?\"Eventually,\" he says drily. \"Took a while though.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tBack in black: Amy performing at Glastonbury in 2008 wearing the Luella Bartley dress. Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nThere is a sense that he doesn't want to come across as overly sentimental or \u00e2\u0080\u0093 worse \u00e2\u0080\u0093 risk cheapening his own, private memories by giving them up for public consumption.And yet Alex is also extremely honest. When I ask if he ever listens to her music, now he shakes his head and admits, a touch shamefacedly, that her songs were \"not really my taste\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I'm more of a rocker than she was.\" And when I touch on the notion that, however much he loved her, it must have been extremely  difficult at times being her brother and  seeing her so hell-bent on  self-destruction, he doesn't flinch.\"Of course. Dad says it all the time: there's only so much you can do. You can be there on the phone, you can go and see them and things, but ultimately, it's your own responsibility and if the person has no interest in getting better, then there really isn't much you can do. You've got to live your own life  as well or it will destroy you as much as the other person.\"Alex has had time to reflect on what triggered Amy's spiral into drink and drugs, but hasn't come to any clear conclusion other than \"we took different paths\". He describes himself as \"a worrier\" and \"an anxious child\". By contrast, \"Amy wasn't like that. She had no limits.\"Many of her problems predated her sudden rise to fame. She developed bulimia in her late teens and the eating disorder dogged her for the rest of her life. Alex remembers her at the age of 17 hanging out with a\u00a0group of girls who \"were all doing it. They'd put loads of rich sauces on their food, scarf it down and throw it up. They stopped doing it, but Amy never really did\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We all knew she was doing it, but it's almost impossible [to tackle] especially if you're not talking about it. It's a real dark, dark issue.\"She suffered from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you knew just by looking at her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Absolutely terrible.\"What does he mean by that? \"I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.\"Emotionally fragile as she was, Alex says his sister never consciously courted media attention. \"All she wanted to be was a singer and have a good career and that was it really. It [the attention] was slightly out of whack with what she was. She won the Brit in 2007 and no one knew who she was before that. I remember bumping into her on the tube once and she was on her own. Then, all of a sudden, that was it. In the space of one evening she'd gone from being able to do whatever she wanted to not being able to do that ever again.\"The drugs and the alcohol, then, were perhaps a way of attempting to deal with the pressure of living a life in the constant public gaze. When she married former music video runner Blake Fielder-Civil\u00a0in 2007, he introduced her to heroin and her problems got markedly worse (the couple divorced in 2009 and Fielder-Civil subsequently served a prison sentence after stealing money to buy drugs). On her darkest days, Winehouse could be a\u00a0nightmare to be around. Most of the time, Alex bit his tongue. But when she got \"really drunk\" and ruined his 30th birthday party, he gave her \"the bollocking of a lifetime\".\"The problem with being [famous] is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how many people tell you 'No'? No one does. I was furious. She was head-butting people, but she's only little, she's tiny so it's like swatting away a\u00a0fly, but it was no good. I had a go at her, threw out some home truths. She knew how I felt and she didn't scream back at me.\"Did she ever apologise for her behaviour? He grins as if this is an absurd question. \"No.\"Did she ever say sorry for any of it, for all the things she put her family through?  \"Of course not.\"And yet, for all the harm she had done to herself, her death, when it came, was truly shocking. Alex was called up by his father with the news. For a while afterwards, the reality of her absence \"didn't really sink in\". As a journalist himself, he was struck by the strangeness of the fact that instead of writing stories about other people, he was now in the epicentre of one of the biggest news stories in the country \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it concerned the death of his sister.\"I had two hats on at that point. The journalist's hat, where I was telling myself to be calm, to assess the situation, don't get emotional. And the brother hat, where I was looking at the flowers, the tributes, the street signs that people had signed.\"The outpouring of public grief in the days after Amy's death was, Alex says, \"really pretty amazing.\"\"Obviously, she touched something in a\u00a0lot of people and, yeah, it was very strange. We had to go to the flat and all the flowers, I\u00a0mean\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" He breaks off and closes his eyes for several seconds as he continues to speak. \"You see those things on the telly, but it's always for things that have got nothing to do with you. This was, like, a personal thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, it was incredible.\"He found the hardest part was having to sit shiva, the week-long\u00a0mourning\u00a0period in\u00a0Judaism\u00a0for first-degree relatives after burial.\"You can't shave, you can't change your clothes. You do prayers. I was sitting in a chair and people came to pay their respects and you're not supposed to say anything back. At my age, that shouldn't be happening. That's something that happens when old people die. People sitting shiva should be in their 70s and 80s, they shouldn't be 31 years old and certainly not a 31-year-old who is sitting shiva for his 27-year-old sister\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can't really describe it, it's a horrible feeling.\"He stays silent for a moment. Then, quickly, he regains his natural equilibrium. We end up chatting about football, his recent move to the countryside with his wife, Riva, and how his work at the foundation is \"easily the best thing I've ever done\". He talks about his earliest memories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 visiting his great-grandfather in the East End on Commercial Street where he still lived after years working as a tailor. Alex is, understandably, more relaxed discussing these areas of his life. The loss of his sister, he says, \"is always there\" but, at the same time, he needs to get on with living.What would Amy have made of this exhibition, I wonder? Alex chuckles. \"She would have hated it.\" He shrugs his shoulders. \"She would have been\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" He assumes her voice, high-pitched and bemused: \"'It's just me, why do you want an exhibition?'\"Amy Winehouse: a Family Portrait opens at the Jewish Museum in London on 3 July (jewishmuseum.org.uk).

How much time do you spend with your co-stars Steve Carell, Russell Brand and Steve Coogan?None. None with any of the other actors ever. That's just how it's  done. It's bizarre. I don't know if  it's a timing thing or scheduling or if the animators are working on a specific character one at a time; I honestly don't even know. But sometimes you'll go in for four  hours, and then two months later you'll go in again for half an hour and a month later you will go in for seven hours. It was almost two years of recording in a studio by yourself. It's very random, but it's really fun, because it's very freeing and you can do a million different takes. And you don't have to worry about hair and makeup.In the film, you voice a new character, Lucy Wilde, who Steve Carell's Gru falls in love with. You're saying that all that chemistry was created in the editing room?I know. I'm almost ashamed to admit that we weren't in the same room because people just think that we're doing these scenes together and we're not. Ever. Not one time. In real life I think I ran into him, but not on the film.The trailer for Anchorman: The Legend Continues was released this week and you definitely appear to be in the same room with Steve Carell in that. It seems like your two characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Find each other.What else can you say about the  movie?I can say that we find each other and it's a good thing. And that's about all I can say about it. They are really not giving too many secrets away about the movie. They want it to be a surprise thing.What did you think of the script?I said yes before I even read it, to be honest. I was such a fan of the first one, so I really would have done anything in the movie, walked around in the background. It wasn't even like work; it was really fun.We haven't seen that much of you in films since Bridesmaids, which of course you co-wrote [with her friend Annie Mumolo] as well as starred in. Were you prepared for the success it had?Noooo! You can never predict that stuff. That was our first thing and I knew that we had a great time making it. I also knew that a lot of people know Paul Feig as a director and of course [producer] Judd Apatow, so people were going to see it and I was terrified. It was the first film I've starred in, so it was more nerves than anything. Yeah, we were shocked.You've said that while Bridesmaids  was not autobiographical you share  quite a few similarities with your character. What do you think people responded to?I don't know, I can't answer that. I have people say a lot of different things: sometimes it's the humour or the friendship or feeling like they are losing their best friend because she's getting married or the mother-daughter relationship. The movie is all of those things to me. We just wrote a movie that made us laugh and we wanted to have a lot of female characters in it.You have already ruled out making a sequel to Bridesmaids \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has it been daunting starting a new screenplay?Of course you feel pressure and what I'm working on is very different from Bridesmaids. I don't know what people will expect, but I want to be able to do different things in different genres. I hope people will be open to that.We should expect a new direction then?Yeah, for sure. A lot of actors don't want to do just one thing. People associate you with how they  know you. For me, it's comedy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so when I say I'm doing something dramatic, people are always a little surprised. But to me, it's like, \"I'm an actor, I do a bunch of things.\" I started on Saturday Night Live and most people know me from Bridesmaids, so of course it makes sense that they would see me as somebody who just does comedies but I hope that I get the opportunity to do everything.Your next film, Girl Most Likely, seems to fit that description. It's about a failed playwright who has to move back home with her mother, played by Annette Bening\u00e2\u0080\u00a6It's a darker comedy. I can never find the right word, because you don't want to say \"dramedy\", just because combining words never works. Annette Bening is obviously and not surprisingly amazing in the movie. She's the best. It's probably one of the highlights of my career working with her.You left Saturday Night Live in 2012  after seven years. Has it been hard to let go? I miss the creative aspect of it: you are constantly writing, constantly  on your toes. It's like your brain is in the best shape ever \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then when you leave, you feel a little like your mind is slowly dulling, because you're not having to fix things and solve puzzles and create on a minute-to-minute basis. But it's long hours and it's all-encompassing. Having been gone now for a while, I do have more time, I'm getting a little more sleep and I see daylight more for sure!So you're taking it easy now?I wish I had more free time. I always feel like such an asshole when I say I don't have any free time but it's been a little bit of a crazy year, it's been unusually busy.One of your projects was the new series of Arrested Development, in which you play the young Lucille Bluth. Was that difficult to turn down?Oh yeah, it's one of the best shows on TV. But it's nerve-racking when you're going into a show that you've been a fan of. It was like showing up on the set of Anchorman: you think, \"I know all these characters, I'm coming into their world.\" You have to do a good job.Despicable Me 2 is out on 28 June;  Girl Most Likely on 26 July\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "The Bridesmaids actress tells Tim Lewis about her unseen cartoon co-stars, finding her dark side, and the benefits of leaving Saturday Night

"Mud, music and mayhem calls  for festival fashion that is  both easy-to-wear and durable", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2013/jun/23/festival-fashion-wear-lauren-laverne", "text": "\n\t    The first time I went to Glastonbury I was 19 and it rained. The weather wasn't just biblical: it was Old Testament. Specifically, the book of Job. My friends and I were in a\u00a0band\u00a0at the time, and due to play, but the stage sank into the rapidly expanding quagmire beneath it, and the gig was cancelled.That was 1997 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pre \"festival fashion\". There were no specific rules regarding attire in those days, except that, since having high self-esteem was \"in\", you just wore your Best Things, possibly with added fairy wings (there were lots of fairies in the 90s, because of ecstasy). Thus we arrived in carelessly impractical, carefully selected charity-shop garb which fared so badly in the Somerset monsoon we were forced to discard it item by item as events unfolded. By\u00a0the time we drove back to London, we were in knickers and bin bags \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even our tour manager, a\u00a0tattooed ex-punk in his 30s.It wouldn't happen now, which is a\u00a0pity: explaining why you're wearing shoes made out of gaffer tape to an impassive Little Chef night manager who won't give you the key to the toilet is character building. These days the trickiest thing about festival attire is that there's simultaneously too much choice and too much uniformity. So with that in mind (and\u00a0plenty of experience in the area as a punter and presenter) here's my festival wardrobe edit.If it's welly weather, wear the right socks (longer than your boots, to avoid calf chafing). I favour dresses, shorts and skirts rather than jeans at festivals, paired with long socks. It looks cuter, and if it's muddy all you have to do is change your socks rather than find somewhere to stash a pair of jeans that look like you just dug them up from a peat bog.Even if it's warm, leave your  flip-flops at home. If the words \"drop toilet\" don't mean anything to you yet, they will once you try to tackle the area that surrounds one with naked feet.See also playsuits/onesies/dungarees. PORTALOOS, guys. PORTALOOS.Layers. I once attended a\u00a0T in the Park that held the dubious distinction of being the only festival in British history to see people admitted to the local A&E with sunstroke and frostbite on the same day. Even if it's glorious at 2pm, 12 hours later you'll still be up, and it will be nippy.Don't wear what you're supposed to. High-street shops are full of festival fashion, but why be in the same faux-ho kit as everybody else if that's not your style? I have found Markus Lupfer's shimmering knits to be surprisingly practical for field-based frolics, and a leopard parka makes a\u00a0welcome change from camo print.If in doubt, all you really need is shades, a hands-free bag and wellies. And maybe a few bin bags\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Follow Lauren on Twitter @LaurenLaverne\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Mud, music and mayhem calls  for festival fashion that is  both

Alberta, leading authorities to evacuate the city of Calgary's entire downtown.The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, called the level of flooding \"stunning\" and said officials don't know yet if it will get worse. Harper also said the water had peaked and stabilized and noted that the weather has improved.Overflowing rivers washed out roads and bridges, soaked homes and turned streets into dirt-brown waterways around southern Alberta. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police sergeant, Patricia Neely, said two bodies had been recovered and a third was in an area that made it too dangerous to recover.As the sun rose in Calgary on Saturday morning, it wasn't raining and some of the 75,000 flood evacuees were holding out hope they might soon be allowed back into their homes. However, Mayor Naheed Nenshi said earlier the downtown area was still without power and remained off-limits. \"It is extremely unlikely that people will be able to return to those buildings before the middle of next week,\" he said.Nenshi also warned there could be another wave of danger ahead. \"There is a scenario in which upstream events at the dams further upstream from the city will lead to another surge in the Bow River,\" he said. \"We don't know how realistic that scenario is, but we will have some hours warning if that actually happens.\"The flood has hit some of the city's iconic structures hard. The Saddledome, home to the NHL's Calgary Flames, was flooded up to the 10th row of seats. That would mean the dressing rooms are submerged as well.Harper, a Calgary resident, said he never imagined there would be a flood of this magnitude in this part of Canada. \"This is incredible. I've seen a little bit of flooding in Calgary before. I don't think any of us have seen anything like this before. The magnitude is just extraordinary,\" he said.\"We're all very concerned that if gets much more than this it could have real impact on infrastructure and other services longer term, so we're hoping things will subside a bit.\"Twenty-five neighborhoods in the city, with an estimated 75,000 residents, were evacuated. About 1,500 have gone to emergency shelters while the rest have found shelter with family or friends, Nenshi said. About 350,000 people work in downtown Calgary on a typical day. However, officials said very few people need to be moved out, since many heeded warnings and did not go to work on Friday.The Alberta premier, Alison Redford, said Medicine Hat, downstream from Calgary, was under a mandatory evacuation order affecting 10,000 residents. Redford warned that communities downstream of Calgary had not yet felt the full force of the floodwater.A spokesman for Canada's defense minister said 1,300 soldiers from a base in Edmonton were being deployed to the flood zone. Police were asking residents who were forced to leave the nearby High River area to register at evacuation shelter. The Town of High River remained under a mandatory evacuation order.The flood was forcing emergency plans at the Calgary Zoo, which is situated on an island near where the Elbow and Bow rivers meet. Lions and tigers were being prepared for transfer, if necessary, to prisoner holding cells at the courthouse.It had been a rainy week throughout much of Alberta, but on Thursday the Bow River Basin was battered with up to four inches of rain.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper says magnitude of flooding in southern Alberta 'is just

Americans' communication", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant", "text": "\n\t    Top secret documents submitted to the court that oversees surveillance by US intelligence agencies show the judges have signed off on broad orders which allow the NSA to make use of information \"inadvertently\" collected from domestic US communications without a warrant.The Guardian is publishing in full two documents submitted to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (known as the Fisa court), signed by Attorney General Eric Holder and stamped 29 July 2009. They detail the procedures the NSA is required to follow to target \"non-US persons\" under its foreign intelligence powers and what the agency does to minimize data collected on US citizens and residents in the course of that surveillance.The documents show that even under authorities governing the collection of foreign intelligence from foreign targets, US communications can still be collected, retained and used. The procedures cover only part of the NSA's surveillance of domestic US communications. The bulk collection of domestic call records, as first revealed by the Guardian earlier this month, takes place under rolling court orders issued on the basis of a legal interpretation of a different authority, section 215 of the Patriot Act.The Fisa court's oversight role has been referenced many times by Barack Obama and senior intelligence officials as they have sought to reassure the public about surveillance, but the procedures approved by the court have never before been publicly disclosed.The top secret documents published today detail the circumstances in which data collected on US persons under the foreign intelligence authority must be destroyed, extensive steps analysts must take to try to check targets are outside the US, and reveals how US call records are used to help remove US citizens and residents from data collection.However, alongside those provisions, the Fisa court-approved policies allow the NSA to:\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Keep data that could potentially contain details of US persons for up to five years;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Retain and make use of \"inadvertently acquired\" domestic communications if they contain usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threat of harm to people or property, are encrypted, or are believed to contain any information relevant to cybersecurity;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Preserve \"foreign intelligence information\" contained within attorney-client communications;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Access the content of communications gathered from \"U.S. based machine[s]\" or phone numbers in order to establish if targets are located in the US, for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance.The broad scope of the court orders, and the nature of the procedures set out in the documents, appear to clash with assurances from President Obama and senior intelligence officials that the NSA could not access Americans' call or email information without warrants.The documents also show that discretion as to who is actually targeted under the NSA's foreign surveillance powers lies directly with its own analysts, without recourse to courts or superiors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though a percentage of targeting decisions are reviewed by internal audit teams on a regular basis.Since the Guardian first revealed the extent of the NSA's collection of US communications, there have been repeated calls for the legal basis of the programs to be released. On Thursday, two US congressmen introduced a bill compelling the Obama administration to declassify the secret legal justifications for NSA surveillance.The disclosure bill, sponsored by Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Todd Rokita, an Indiana Republican, is a complement to one proposed in the Senate last week. It would \"increase the transparency of the Fisa Court and the state of the law in this area,\" Schiff told the Guardian. \"It would give the public a better understanding of the safeguards, as well as the scope of these programs.\"Section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act (FAA), which was renewed for five years last December, is the authority under which the NSA is allowed to collect large-scale data, including foreign communications and also communications between the US and other countries, provided the target is overseas.FAA warrants are issued by the Fisa court for up to 12 months at a time, and authorise the collection of bulk information \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of which can include communications of US citizens, or people inside the US. To intentionally target either of those groups requires an individual warrant.One-paragraph orderOne such warrant seen by the Guardian shows that they do not contain detailed legal rulings or explanation. Instead, the one-paragraph order, signed by a Fisa court judge in 2010, declares that the procedures submitted by the attorney general on behalf of the NSA are consistent with US law and the fourth amendment.Those procedures state that the \"NSA determines whether a person is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be outside the United States in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the information available with respect to that person, including information concerning the communications facility or facilities used by that person\".It includes information that the NSA analyst uses to make this determination \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including IP addresses, statements made by the potential target, and other information in the NSA databases, which can include public information and data collected by other agencies.Where the NSA has no specific information on a person's location, analysts are free to presume they are overseas, the document continues.\"In the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States person,\" it states \"a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or whose location is not known will be presumed to be a non-United States person unless such person can be positively identified as a United States person.\"If it later appears that a target is in fact located in the US, analysts are permitted to look at the content of messages, or listen to phone calls, to establish if this is indeed the case.Referring to steps taken to prevent intentional collection of telephone content of those inside the US, the document states: \"NSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a foreign target has entered or intends to enter the United States. Such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic and intelligence requirements and priorities.\"Details set out in the \"minimization procedures\", regularly referred to in House and Senate hearings, as well as public statements in recent weeks, also raise questions as to the extent of monitoring of US citizens and residents.NSA minimization procedures signed by Holder in 2009 set out that once a target is confirmed to be within the US, interception must stop immediately. However, these circumstances do not apply to large-scale data where the NSA claims it is unable to filter US communications from non-US ones.The NSA is empowered to retain data for up to five years and the policy states \"communications which may be retained include electronic communications acquired because of limitations on the NSA's ability to filter communications\".Even if upon examination a communication is found to be domestic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 entirely within the US \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the NSA can appeal to its director to keep what it has found if it contains \"significant foreign intelligence information\", \"evidence of a crime\", \"technical data base information\" (such as encrypted communications), or \"information pertaining to a threat of serious harm to life or property\".Domestic communications containing none of the above must be destroyed. Communications in which one party was outside the US, but the other is a US-person, are permitted for retention under FAA rules.The minimization procedure adds that these can be disseminated to other agencies or friendly governments if the US person is anonymised, or including the US person's identity under certain criteria.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tHolder's 'minimization procedure' says once a target is confirmed to be in the US, interception of communication must stop. Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nA separate section of the same document notes that as soon as any intercepted communications are determined to have been between someone under US criminal indictment and their attorney, surveillance must stop. However, the material collected can be retained, if it is useful, though in a segregated database:\"The relevant portion of the communication containing that conversation will be segregated and the National Security Division of the Department of Justice will be notified so that appropriate procedures may be established to protect such communications from review or use in any criminal prosecution, while preserving foreign intelligence information contained therein,\" the document states.In practice, much of the decision-making appears to lie with NSA analysts, rather than the Fisa court or senior officials.A transcript of a 2008 briefing on FAA from the NSA's general counsel sets out how much discretion NSA analysts possess when it comes to the specifics of targeting, and making decisions on who they believe is a non-US person. Referring to a situation where there has been a suggestion a target is within the US.\"Once again, the standard here is a reasonable belief that your target is outside the United States. What does that mean when you get information that might lead you to believe the contrary? It means you can't ignore it. You can't turn a blind eye to somebody saying: 'Hey, I think so and so is in the United States.' You can't ignore that. Does it mean you have to completely turn off collection the minute you hear that? No, it means you have to do some sort of investigation: 'Is that guy right? Is my target here?\" he says.\"But, if everything else you have says 'no' (he talked yesterday, I saw him on TV yesterday, even, depending on the target, he was in Baghdad) you can still continue targeting but you have to keep that in mind. You can't put it aside. You have to investigate it and, once again, with that new information in mind, what is your reasonable belief about your target's location?\"The broad nature of the court's oversight role, and the discretion given to NSA analysts, sheds light on responses from the administration and internet companies to the Guardian's disclosure of the PRISM program. They have stated that the content of online communications is turned over to the NSA only pursuant to a court order. But except when a US citizen is specifically targeted, the court orders used by the NSA to obtain that information as part of Prism are these general FAA orders, not individualized warrants specific to any individual.Once armed with these general orders, the NSA is empowered to compel telephone and internet companies to turn over to it the communications of any individual identified by the NSA. The Fisa court plays no role in the selection of those individuals, nor does it monitor who is selected by the NSA.The NSA's ability to collect and retain the communications of people in the US, even without a warrant, has fuelled congressional demands for an estimate of how many Americans have been caught up in surveillance.Two US senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both members of the Senate intelligence committee \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have been seeking this information since 2011, but senior White House and intelligence officials have repeatedly insisted that the agency is unable to gather such statistics.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Fisa court submissions show broad scope of procedures governing NSA's surveillance of Americans' communication",

It is a magnificent setting in\u00a0a\u00a0tiny town called Marceau on the shores of Lake Annecy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 surrounded by snow-topped mountains, it is a scene that once inspired the paintings of Paul C\u00c3\u00a9zanne. The ageing couple enjoy watching local paragliders take off as they sit on their large balcony, but this utopian picture of a quiet retirement is about to be shattered.Mastro answers an aggressive knock on the door and is greeted by a team of French policemen who march in and announce that they are arresting him and his wife. In the chaos, Linda throws pills into her mouth, which the police forcefully remove, while other officers start searching the property. The pair are then told to prepare for their immediate extradition to the United States, handcuffed and dumped in separate police cells.\"It was like the Gestapo coming in,\" says Linda. \"I did not take anything that was suicidal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I took my migraine pills. The toilet [in the police cell] was a hole in the ground. There were lunatics in there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don't know if they were drug-induced, but they screamed and yelled and slammed against the bars all night long\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was so ludicrous. Here we are, two senior citizens, and [the police] are so ecstatic that they'd caught us.\"The idea of the Mastros \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now 88 and 63 years old, but looking much younger as they sit shoulder to shoulder on a large sofa \u00e2\u0080\u0093 being hauled from their home seems utterly ridiculous. But the French police really had captured a pair of international fugitives who had been on the run from US authorities for 16 months after ignoring a bankruptcy judge's order to return two massive diamond rings. Theirs is a story of a husband and wife, supposedly in their dotage, being pursued by the FBI as they fled America for Canada and then Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a dash that was completed with their three Shih Tzu dogs,  the family Range Rover and suitcases stuffed with millions of dollars' worth of jewellery.It is also a story of an old couple leaving their \"friends and family investors\" $100m out of pocket only to spend seven weeks in French jails and, after release, being electronically tagged for six months. Yet as creditors continue to circle Mastro's bankrupt empire, the French courts have resisted US efforts to bring the couple home. Comparing the tale to a pair  of Hollywood movies, one observer sums up the saga thus: \"It's like Catch Me If You Can meets Cocoon.\"MICHAEL and Linda Mastro were once influential figures in Seattle \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he as a highly successful property developer and she, as she puts it, as a member of the city's \"high society\". They had met in 1974 at the Peoples Bank, where Linda worked. They talk of their  \"perfect life\" and having to \"pinch themselves\" at what a fortunate position they found  themselves in. They lived in a $15m \"waterfront residence\" located in Medina, Washington state, which was stocked with cellars housing $23,000 worth of wine, a $20,000 Steinway grand piano and a $24,000 collection of works by the American glass sculptor Dale Chihuly. The couple drove a Bentley, a Rolls-Royce Phantom and the Range Rover. These were  the trappings of a $350m fortune, which is what they had amassed just before Mastro joined the queue of casualties created by the financial crisis.As the financial world began to implode in 2008, Mastro attempted to alleviate the concerns of his investors, who loaned his business money on the promise of high rates of interest. He wrote: \"Our organisation is strong and healthy, in no small part because of the relationship we value so greatly with lenders including you, our friends and family. I hope this report has eased any concerns you may have.\"That letter was sent at the end of September, but around two weeks later Mastro moved his most significant assets into a Belize-based \"offshore asset protection trust\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of which he and his wife were the primary beneficiaries. \"My lawyer in 2008 had been after me for a long time to set up diversionary accounts for estates purposes, the theory being that you don't have all your eggs in one basket,\" he recalls now. \"We put the house in it, the cars in it, the jewellery in it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [It was done] in case you fall on hard times, then creditors can't grab everything.\"Mastro describes such arrangements as commonplace, but for a routine move it proved uncannily prescient. He actually did fall on hard times as the value of his properties crashed during the financial crisis, meaning his investments were suddenly worth less than his loans. He was forced into bankruptcy in 2009 with debts of around $600m, and his creditors soon took a different view of the Belize arrangements to Mastro's lawyers. In December 2010 the courts overrode the scheme and a\u00a0fire sale of the Mastros' Medina home \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which they had bought for $15m \u00e2\u0080\u0093 raised $8m.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tStill waters: the Mastros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 $15m residence in Medina, Washington state, complete with wine cellar and Steinway grand piano. Photograph: John Lok/The Seattle Times\n\t\t\t\n            \nWith the house gone and their reputation in Seattle shredded, the couple relocated to California. But by 2011, when Mastro says he was earning hundreds of thousands of dollars from property consultancy and even harbouring thoughts of paying creditors back \"a little  at a time\", two further setbacks occurred.Having won a court judgement stating that two rings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which housed huge diamonds, one of 27.8 carats and one of 15.93 carats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were the sole property of Linda, the courts overturned that decision in June 2011 and ordered the  jewels to be handed back. That move came shortly after a devastating blow in February.\"My husband was in the garage and fell off the step-stool and literally died,\" recalls Linda. \"They resuscitated him and then he had a cranial. He was a vegetable for several months. He had to learn to walk again. Then everything disintegrated.\"\"I had a nervous breakdown,\" she continues. \"I just wanted to get away. It wasn't that I didn't respect the court \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I just couldn't take any more. The initial plan was to go to Seattle, which we did. We stayed with [Mastro's sister] a couple of nights and then I said: 'Let's just go.' I don't know what came over me.\"PRIVATE jets tend not to allow Shih Tzu dogs as passengers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which was proving an irritation after a few weeks travelling across Canada and staying in \"little crappy motels\". The Mastros had arrived in Toronto, a city they loved and didn't want to leave, but they say their lawyers encouraged them to keep moving. \"All three sets of attorneys we had, their favourite saying was 'Get out of Dodge',\" Mastro says. \"It didn't take much prodding to get  us out of there because the press coverage was so unfavourable.\"Headlines such as the Wall Street Journal's \"Living Large in Bankruptcy\" and the Seattle Times's \"Suit alleges 'sham' transfers of IOUs to shield assets\" may have irked, but there was an added urgency to disappear as well. They had fled over the US-Canadian border while still in possession of the diamond rings they could not bear to surrender, meaning they were being tailed by a\u00a0US marshal intent on bringing them home to face civil contempt of court charges. \"We had a friend in Seattle who had a plane, so we called his pilot and they started looking around for a plane for us,\" continues Linda. \"We found a\u00a0puddle-jumper \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it was fine, we didn't care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that would take the dogs. We went through this private firm and I thought  the shortest distance would be to Portugal.\"The flight on that small private plane, which stopped in Greenland, proved a devastating blow for the couple's North American pursuers, with the Mastros and the diamonds vanishing from the radar. With dry understatement Jim Rigby, the accountant hired by the US Department of Justice to recover assets for creditors, says: \"If I could have afforded the emotion, I'd have been profoundly frustrated.\"He would remain so until the knock on the Mastros' door in the autumn of 2012.EVEN the Mastros' fiercest critics find it difficult to argue that they were making massive efforts to hide, having finally decided to settle by Lake Annecy on the advice of a Seattle priest and friend. They lived under their own name and appear to have become convinced that the US authorities would not follow them to Europe on a civil matter.But unbeknown to them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Rigby says to himself, too \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a\u00a0federal grand jury had finalised an indictment accusing the couple of 43 counts of bankruptcy fraud. As well as citing the timely transfer of assets to the Belize trust, the document also alleges the \"fraudulent concealment\" by the couple of a JP Morgan Chase bank account used to fund personal expenses and from which they withdrew almost $600,000. \"I\u00a0did not disclose that in the paperwork I\u00a0submitted,\" Mastro admits  now. \"I'm responsible for that. My attorney said it was not necessary. Anyway, they nailed me on that.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tBelow the radar: Mastro (second left) being led to his safety deposit box. He funded his life in France with cheques ranging between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2,000 and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac8,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Low enough not to set off any red flags\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\t\t\t\n            \nThe grand jury's charges, coupled with the couple making two extraordinary mistakes, meant their arrest was almost inevitable. First Mastro, who has needed frequent surgery since his \"eardrums were blown out in World War Two\", had a small hearing operation in France. Behind his wife's back, and against her pleading, he claimed the cost of the treatment on his US insurance policy.Linda is still fuming at her husband's \"sly\" move, but she had left a trail, too, after following local rules and registering their Range Rover in France once they'd shipped it to Lisbon. As she explains that move \u00e2\u0080\u0093 without a hint of irony relating to her fugitive status \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \"I have to do things right. I never even  jaywalked.\" Whatever the reasons, the outcome was clear. US authorities now had everything they needed to ask their European  colleagues to bring the suspects in.Following that first night spent in the police station, the Mastros were transported 90 miles to a prison in Lyon, which Linda found particularly gruesome. There was a plastic mattress and a piece of \"crappy muslin\" as a cover, all of which contributed to Linda's openly depressed demeanour; she was put on suicide watch.\"I laid there and cried,\" she says, welling up as she speaks. \"Then I found out that [one of my] dogs had died. That's when I gave up and they watched me. I didn't care if I got out of there. I just wanted to die.\"But the Mastros' incarceration was having a\u00a0revitalising effect on the case for their pursuers. Rigby now knew where they were and was feverishly searching for clues of further funds. The euphoria, however, quickly gave rise to a\u00a0problem. The Mastros had been picked up in a lovely \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but modest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 property. If they had fled after squirrelling away millions, why was there no sign of largesse?DAYS earlier, Rigby had hired some new recruits to assist his effort. Daniel Hall, a\u00a0former lawyer turned corporate investigator, had just set up his own investigations agency called Focus, where he worked from a small office overlooking the Old Bailey, London's famous criminal court.The case was made for Hall, whose speciality was tracing hidden assets, and on hearing news of the arrest he turned to his colleague Robert Capper, a former British intelligence officer, and dispatched him to France.Capper immediately visited the chief of police in Annecy, only to receive an incredibly cool reception. With reason. The small station was already investigating the shooting of the 50-year-old Surrey-based engineer Saad al-Hilli, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, which had horrified the region weeks earlier. What's more, the police were still wrestling with exactly what had been happening in their quiet little town after a surprise drowning in the picturesque Lake Annecy a year earlier dredged up more than they'd bargained for: several bodies.\"The police had had in those past few months: two American fugitives; a massacre of Brits, which creates a media storm, and a\u00a0guy who falls out of boat,\" Capper recalls. \"And they find his body but then have to ask: who are these other three bodies we have found at the bottom of the lake? This police office has got about eight staff. It's like Midsomer.\"The one piece of useful information the overworked police deputy did give Capper was that while the Mastros had been arrested in Marceau, it was not the first address the US authorities had sent French police to. The first call had been made to a property on the lake's eastern shore \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the far more glamorous  Veyrier-du-Lac.\"One of the things we were thinking is: 'Does this guy have money?'\" says Capper. \"He fled but was found in an ordinary flat. Then we discover he had been staying at Veyrier-du-Lac for the majority of the stay. That makes more sense. If you were a\u00a0very wealthy man, you would  stay there.\"In Veyrier-du-Lac, the caf\u00c3\u00a9 owner recalled the ageing American couple with the Shih Tzu dogs who always popped in for a coffee on their way into town \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and before long Capper had painstakingly pieced together a picture of their life, virtually all of which the couple now confirm: it included the magnificent Veyrier-du-Lac house, rented at around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac5,000 a month; how the Mastros had been forced to leave that base because the villa had already been let for the summer to other tenants and, intriguingly, how the couple had opened a bank account  in the Veyrier-du-Lac branch of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9  G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale.The account was being funded frequently by company cheques ranging in value between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2,000 and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac8,000 each time. \"Low enough not to set off any red flags,\" observes Hall conspiratorially. \"Suspicious activity reports come in at more than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac10,000.\"Still, it raised a wider question. The Mastros had funds to finance being on the run \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but where was the cash coming from? Back in Seattle, Rigby was hatching plans for a bold move that provided the answer.A Renault Clio, with a poodle sitting in the back seat, comes to a halt right outside the Mastros' Marceau flat. Out of the car hops a\u00a0velvet-suited man, looking the very antithesis of his trade. Following a request from Rigby, the French courts had appointed him as the bailiff on the French side of the Mastro case. After entering the three-bedroom property, he reaches a box room at the end of the  flat's corridor.On opening the door he is presented with a room stuffed full of cases overflowing with designer clothes and jewels: Christian Dior suits with Linda Mastro's name stitched into the inside of the seam; carrier bags full of jewellery; freezer bags full of ropes of pearls, others stuffed with earrings. After taking a\u00a0moment, he finally finds the word to express his mood. \"Merde,\" he gasps before trooping off to call his office to request reinforcements.Also in the room that day is Capper, in a\u00a0purely observational capacity, but with an entirely different focus. \"The bailiff is saying: 'That's shiny, that's Louis Vuitton, I'm having that,'\" he recalls. \"But what's really interesting to us is the business cards, scraps of paper, written notes, luggage labels.\"Also in and among the treasure are dozens of notepads in which Mastro has fastidiously handwritten every financial transaction, plus, shoved into a drawer, a folded piece of paper with names and numbers of Mastro contacts in Switzerland and a weathered business card.The number on the business card was for a\u00a0\"cash for gold\" shop on the shore of Lake Annecy, where the Mastros had opened an account and were making regular deposits. Over time, it is thought that the total gold they had sold came to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all paid out via company cheques. The values, again, were between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2,000 and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac8,000 a time. \"It was our intention to gradually sell the jewellery [excluding the diamond rings] to meet our  living expenses,\" confirms Mastro. \"We thought we had two, three, four million  dollars' worth of jewellery.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tRich haul: some of the jewels recovered from the Mastros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 flat in Marceau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there were around 300 pieces, with a total value of $3m.\n\t\t\t\n            \nThe modus operandi was becoming clearer and clearer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at least in the minds of Rigby and his investigators. They believe the Range Rover was shipped to Lisbon as a Trojan horse full of jewels which were sold to fund the  Mastros' lavish, if low-profile, lifestyle. Apart from the fateful insurance payment, the Mastros never moved money via wire transfers that would have provided clues to their whereabouts. They fastidiously kept their own ledger \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so when they noticed their bank  balance approaching zero, they would simply sell some more gold.These were answers, but the information posed further questions: did this ageing couple know that these actions would make their detection harder? Were they getting help?ON MASTRO'S iPad was a series of photographs, one of which was a piece of paper containing written instructions explaining how a car could be imported to Portugal and not attract attention from customs officials.Capper also photographed a map found in the Mastros' flat. \"They had annotated in many different pens and ink all sorts of places across Europe,\" he explains. \"So there were rings around places such as Monaco and San Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n as well as Annecy. A few places where they had crossed out roads. When  the FBI came to France for a briefing on what  I had discovered, one of the junior Annecy policemen in the room looked at a road that had been crossed out. He said: 'Oh, that's the new tunnel into Italy. There's police everywhere there.' The route into Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry  was also crossed out. I\u00a0drove that route.  Every car got stopped by customs.\"The Mastros ridicule the suggestion that they have acquired some sort of manual for the aspiring international fugitive which explains the secrets of avoiding detection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and insist they don't recognise the descriptions of the note on customs procedures or any map with warnings of potentially troublesome roads.\"[Rigby] got it all wrong,\" says Linda. \"How could anybody be so stupid as to leave a car in a\u00a0parking lot with jewellery in it and they've got the key? Mike and I were bent over laughing on that one.\"There is an edge to her voice as, by her own admission, she is taking Rigby's pursuit personally. \"In my opinion he has a vendetta against me,\" she says, and claims that the search of the couple's property was conducted overzealously.Rigby dismisses any personal motive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 although he acknowledges that the case is likely to be the biggest of his career. And in Rigby's defence, any neutral observer would need to point out that Linda's take on events is not always considered reliable. A 2011 judgement by the US bankruptcy courts found her \"to be a witness lacking veracity, as her testimony was often transparently vague, contradictory and self-serving\". Meanwhile Mastro himself openly admits to playing games with the whole bankruptcy process. In early 2009, before his empire collapsed, Mastro borrowed against his luxury cars. \"I got the money, put it in my business, and I\u00a0knew if I got in trouble and the trustee grabbed those cars, there would be no value in there,\" he admits now. \"I\u00a0put large loans on [the cars] to thwart Rigby.\"WHO IS currently winning this game of financial chess remains a debating point. The Mastros reckon it is Rigby as, they say, he has reclaimed everything they own and they are now forced to live off a $2,000-a-month US pension plus donations from friends. Rigby suspects, but says he has no proof, that there are millions more in assets stashed away offshore. \"He thinks to this day that we have much money buried overseas,\" Mastro says. \"We don't have a cent in that respect.\"But whoever is leading, the losers are obvious. Rigby has so far managed to collect $20.5m, of which the unsecured creditors, including \"friends and family investors\", have received just $2.2m. That compares with $1.6m that has gone on property maintenance and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to banks and Rigby.Now there is a chance of getting creditors a\u00a0few million more. At a bail hearing in France, Mastro revealed that the diamond rings were stashed in a safety deposit box in Annecy. After the box was drilled open, the rings were recovered and now, along with the items gleaned from the Marceau flat, the haul is in the hands of the FBI. There are around 300 pieces with an estimated value of $3m \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it is not yet certain in whose hands the collection will  end up.The Mastros look likely to live out their days in France after the country's courts refused America's extradition request on humanitarian grounds earlier this month. Having masterminded that case, their lawyer Thomas Terrier is making their stay as comfortable as possible by getting their jewels back. He is keeping the extraordinary four-year saga running by making a fresh claim to have the jewellery handed back to Linda. \"We will now be able to say [to Rigby]: 'Why did you act that way at that time?'\" Terrier says. \"It was not appropriate to seize everything that way. It's another session which begins.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Michael Mastro was a Seattle property magnate worth $350m. Then the market crashed.

Georgetown University", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/23/obama-climate-change", "text": "\n\t    Barack Obama will unveil a national climate change plan on Tuesday, offering the first real glimpse of how he intends to make good on one of the most stirring promises of his inaugural address.In a video posted on the White House web site on Saturday, the US president reiterated his view that climate change was the challenge of a generation.The goals he will outline in his speech at Georgetown University will be equally ambitious, encompassing \"a national plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare our country for the impacts of climate change, and lead global efforts to fight it\", Obama said.There will likely be strong reactions from Republicans in Congress, who oppose action on climate change as  well as from fellow Democrats. Some campaigners will also doubtless argue Obama should do much more to stop global warming.In concrete terms, there is widespread expectation Obama will announce he is using his executive powers as president to direct federal government agencies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, and to encourage energy efficiency.He is also expected to step up government programmes promoting the expansion of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power especially on public land.The video also seemed to suggest that Obama would seek to involve his council of scientific advisors in drawing up a strategy for protecting American cities and coastlines from the worst consequences of climate change.Some of the policy elements in Obama's address were previewed earlier in the week in a speech by the White House climate advisor, Heather Zichal.In a forum sponsored by the New Republic magazine, Zichal suggested Obama would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.Coal-fired power plants are the single largest source of America's greenhouse gas emissions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 responsible for up to 40% of carbon pollution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and have long been a target of campaigners.The Obama administration has already taken steps to raising standards on new power plants. But it has balked until now at imposing tougher standards on existing power plants \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a measure which would deliver the biggest cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.There was intense speculation ahead of Tuesday's speech about whether Obama would promise to curb emissions of existing facilities.The president's comments in a speech in Berlin this week seemed to suggest he was prepared for bolder action.\"Our dangerous carbon emissions have come down, but we know we have to do more, and we will do more,\" Obama told the crowd.Zichal in her remarks this week also indicated EPA regulations would be part of Obama's climate plan.\"Going forward, obviously the EPA is going to be working very hard on rules that focus specifically on greenhouse gas emissions from the coal sector,\" she said. \"They're doing a lot of important work on that space.\"Tuesday's speech is likely to provoke strong reactions across the political spectrum.John Boehner, the house speaker, pre-empted the speech by several days, telling Fox news on Thursday it would be \"absolutely crazy\" to use the EPA to reduce carbon emissions.On the opposite end of the political divide, Obama will be under intense pressure on Tuesday to offer some assurances to opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline.The project, intended to carry tar sands crude from Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, has become a key issue for campaigners, who say it is a core test of Obama's environmental commitments.A number of prominent Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as well as 145 veterans of Obama's election campaigns \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have come out against the pipeline.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "US president will unveil blueprint for reducing carbon pollution in speech at

stadium has been built for next year's tournament", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/22/brazil-favelas-frontline-world-cup", "text": "\n\t    Wednesday night was due to be a celebration in Fortaleza. This north-eastern coastal city was the first in Brazil to complete its World Cup stadium in readiness for the 2014 contest. Things didn't quite work out as planned.\"After the first teargas bomb, my brother and I ran with a few others to flee the police,\" said Julia Lopes, 27, who was among 30,000 local people demonstrating before the Brazilian national side's showcase Confederations Cup match against Mexico. \"My husband Pedro ran in the opposite direction. Later I met him \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he had a swollen eye.\"Brazil is experiencing something very big and we cannot completely understand it now. During the demonstration we saw many claims, not only concerning the World Cup, but some that were more political. Some were clear and others vague. People were definitely asking: who is the World Cup for?\"The sudden explosion of resentment and frustration in Fortaleza was repeated in cities throughout Brazil last week.On Friday, thousands again took to the streets to demand new spending priorities in a country whose recent economic boom has made global headlines. Dilma Rousseff, the president, responded by saying that she had an obligation to listen to the voices on the street.In Fortaleza \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the fifth most unequal city in the world, according to the United Nations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the protests were led by the young and middle-class. But the website of Comit\u00c3\u00aa Popular da Copa e das Olimp\u00c3\u00adadas makes clear its concerns include those of the poorest. The World Cup, say campaigners, has justified \"the distancing of the poorest to remote areas on the fringes of Fortaleza, causing segregation and social distinction\". You don't have to walk far into the city's desperate suburbs to understand their concern.Outside a row of breezeblock houses along a dirt road in Bom Jardim, one of the most violent favelas in Fortaleza, social worker Silvana Severo rips open the parcel of flour, beans and other food that she is bringing to a family. \"We do that to stop them selling on the food for drugs,\" she says.The precaution is routine for the social workers who visit the poorest families living in some of the more than 400 favelas that encircle the fifth largest city in Brazil. But they could not prevent the sale, a few months earlier, of a baby by her mother for 50 reais (\u00c2\u00a315). The child, rescued from the trafficker, is now toddling around outside the house in just a nappy.Inside, seven people are crowded into the sparsely furnished living room, where the baby's grandmother, Felicia, says she is no longer smoking crack and plans to find her own house. They are struggling, but their situation is a big improvement on the days when the whole family lived on the streets, including Paulo, 14, who is staying at a shelter for street children run by a charity, the Pequeno Nazareno (PN).Then the social workers visit the family of Emerson, also 14, who once lived on the streets. His brother was shot dead by gang members last year when he went back to his old favela for a concert. Outside the home of a third boy, Sandro, 13, the team hear cries and inside find a young baby swinging in a hammock, left entirely alone.In recent years more than 350,000 people have emerged from extreme poverty \u00e2\u0080\u0093 classified as living on 70\u00a0reais or less a month \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the state of Cear\u00c3\u00a1, but hardship is still widespread. Statistics from Ipece, the Cear\u00c3\u00a1 institute of research and economic strategy, show that more than 133,000 people were living in severe poverty in Fortaleza in 2011. A third of inhabitants live without sanitation and there is a dire lack of adequate housing. In Barroso, a community built on a rubbish dump, residents hunt for recyclable goods while their children run past flying plastic bags on string.The renovation of Fortaleza's stadium for the World Cup cost 519m reais (\u00c2\u00a3149m). The match against Mexico on Wednesday marked the return of the national team to the Arena Castel\u00c3\u00a3o after 11 years. According to Lopes, \"the committee [Comit\u00c3\u00aa Popular Copa e Olimp\u00c3\u00adadas] has been debating the legacy of the World Cup for the past three years and investigating how investments are made. What we have seen proves the country is going to be the stage for an enormous abuse by Fifa \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the endorsement of the government.\"Speaking from Rio de Janeiro, political scientist Luiz Eduardo Soares, the former minister of public security under President Lula da Silva, says the protests nationwide reflect an unwillingness to go along with a new public image that is at odds with reality. \"There are several agendas [of the protests] but citizenship rights, the quality of public services, the choice of priorities and the ruin of politics are the core. People cannot stand any longer the theatre of authorities and political leaders pretending that everything is getting better in our land of promises, in our tropical paradise.\"For Forteleza's poor, the World Cup has meant changes, including the forced removal of 5,000 people from communities Lagoa da Zeza and Vila Cazumba to areas without schools, and fears that the tournament will increase exploitation of children in a city that has been trying to shake off its reputation for sex tourism.\"There would be no problem in investing in better stadiums and infrastructure to benefit the mega-events [World Cup and Olympics]. The problem starts when, one suspects, corruption is involved in the way vast amounts of money are spent at the same time as there is no investment in education or hospitals,\" says Bernardo Rosemeyer, the founder of PN.Street children are at the sharp end of the social divide in Fortaleza. Around 300 are believed to have fled to the streets because of poverty, abuse or other problems at home. While social welfare programmes such as the Bolsa Fam\u00c3\u00adlia have lifted millions of Brazilians out of poverty, many of the poorest do not qualify for such assistance because their children do not attend school or they have no fixed address. Some fear that, as has happened in the past, homeless children will be bussed out of the city when visitors start to arrive. For now, they exist in a twilight zone of begging, stealing or working on the streets, at risk of falling into prostitution or drugs.At night on the Beira Mar, a stretch of road that is lined with hotels and bars, PN worker Antonio Carlos is searching for children sleeping rough. His aim is to persuade them to visit PN and then to begin the process of reintegrating them into their families, where possible. Tonight he meets Elena, the woman who sold her baby to the trafficker. She is obviously high on crack cocaine. At just 22, having already spent more than a decade on the streets, for her it may be too late.Hopefully, however, it won't be for the boys living at the shelter, where PN provides schooling, healthcare, counselling \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the chance to be children and play football. For Paulo, Emerson and Sandro, the World Cup has had a positive impact on their lives in one sense \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are in the boys' team that will represent Brazil in the Street Child World Cup that takes place before the Fifa championships in Rio de Janeiro in March 2014.The tournament will bring together teams of former street children from up to 20 countries for a 10-day event that aims to raise awareness of street children and give them a platform.For these three boys and the other members of their team in Fortaleza, as well as the girls' team from the Ibiss project in Rio, playing in the tournament is the chance to be part of a society where they are largely invisible, to demonstrate their talents and forget the hardships of life. No one would dream of begrudging them that chance. But in Forteleza, as elsewhere in Brazil, among broad swaths of the population, the enthusiasm for the real thing is ebbing away as a nation takes a hard look at the priorities of its elite.\n    ",

"\n\t    President Obama will nominate Jim Comey to be the next FBI director on Friday, picking a former Justice Department official who has deep experience in the US battle against terrorism, a White House official said on Thursday.If confirmed by the Senate, Comey, a Republican, would replace FBI director Robert Mueller, who has led the agency since just before the 9/11 attacks. Mueller is expected to step down this fall.A White House official said Obama would make the announcement about Comey on Friday afternoon.\"In more than two decades as a prosecutor and national security professional, Jim has demonstrated unwavering toughness, integrity, and principle in defending both our security and our values,\" the official said.Comey, 52, served as deputy US attorney general for President George W Bush. He had previously been the US attorney for the southern district of New York.As assistant US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, Comey had handled the Khobar Towers bombing case that arose out of an attack on a US military facility in Saudi Arabia in 1996. Seventeen US military members died in the attack.Comey gained notoriety for refusing in 2004 to certify the legal aspects of NSA domestic surveillance during a stint as acting attorney general while John Ashcroft was hospitalized with pancreatitis.That refusal prompted two senior White House officials \u00e2\u0080\u0093 counsel Alberto Gonzales and chief of staff Andrew Card \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to try to persuade Ashcroft to sign the certification. Comey, who was in the room, said Ashcroft refused.Comey later told the Senate judiciary committee at a 2007 hearing that the situation was \"probably the most difficult night of my professional life.\" His actions endeared him to many Democrats opposed to Bush's domestic surveillance program.The surveillance program resurfaced as a major bone of contention this month when it was revealed that the US government maintained an expansive surveillance program targeting internet and phone communications. Obama has staunchly defended the program.Comey, after leaving the Justice Department in 2005, became general counsel to aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp until 2010. He most recently joined Columbia University's law school as a senior research scholar after working for Bridgewater Associates, an investment fund, from 2010 to 2013.The Washington-based Federal Bureau of Investigation serves as both a federal criminal investigative agency and a domestic intelligence body.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Comey, 52, who formerly worked at the

Spanish police have arrested eight men who formed part of a terrorist recruitment network that sent 50 men to carry out attacks for al-Qaida-linked groups in Syria, the interior minister said on Saturday.Jorge Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez Diaz said the arrests in the Spanish north African enclave of Ceuta had disbanded and \"neutralised\" the network.Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez Diaz said those who went to Syria had fought against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and some had taken part in suicide bombings. He said 12 of the 50 militants who went to Syria had been recruited in Ceuta and the rest in Morocco, adding that some had been minors.\"We are not talking of combatants, soldiers, in the war in Syria, but of the capture of jihadists whose sole end was to carry out terrorist attacks,\" he said.He said that recruits were given training and finance by the network, which had two bases, one in Ceuta and the other in Morocco.Once trained to a point where they would be able to carry out terrorist attacks, the recruits were taken to Turkey, where they were transported to the border with Syria before being \"introduced to the conflict zones.\"He said police had been able to determine that the network's recruits had gone on to perpetrate terror attacks as part of the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra organisation and also the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, a Sunni extremist group.Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez Diaz said that when members who had been involved in terror attacks in Syria returned to Europe they remained a threat to security, some as potential \"lone wolf\" terrorist who needed to be arrested.He said these types of militants were highly radicalised and trained to continue with the jihad or holy war on an individual scale that was \"a real and serious threat to our security.\"The identities of those arrested were not revealed.\n    ", "og:type": "article",

Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower, is believed to have arrived in Moscow after Hong Kong authorities allowed him to leave despite a US request for his arrest.In a statement, WikiLeaks saidthe 30-year-old was heading to a democratic country \"via a safe route\" for asylum purposes and that the organisation was assisting at his request. Snowden had been in hiding in Hong Kong since identifying himself as the source of revelations on US surveillance programmes.His flight from US authorities, which want to charge him with espionage, appeared set to continue with an onward flight west from Moscow to Havana on Monday. From there, various reports indicated that he would try to get to either Caracas, or Quito.The Hong Kong government said on Sunday he had left of his own accord \"through a lawful and normal channel\" and said the request filed by the US did not fully comply with legal requirements. Pointedly, it also said it wanted Washington to clarify Snowden's claims that the US had hacked targets in the territory.The move came two days after the US announced it had charged him with espionage and hours after the US stepped up pressure on Hong Kong to issue a provisional warrant for Snowden's arrest with a view to his surrender.Snowden had previously said he would stay in Hong Kong and fight for his freedom through the courts. He had been at a safe house since 10 June, when he checked out of his hotel after giving an interview to the Guardian revealing himself as the source who leaked top secret US documents.His unexpected departure comes a day after the US sought to turn up pressure on the territory, with a senior administration official telling the Washington Post: \"If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law.\"Sunday's statement from the Hong Kong authorities said: \"Since the documents provided by the US government did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law, the HKSAR government has requested the US government to provide additional information so that the department of justice could consider whether the US government's request can meet the relevant legal conditions.\"As the HKSAR government has yet to have sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr Snowden from leaving Hong Kong.\"The HKSAR government has already informed the US government of Mr Snowden's departure.\"Meanwhile, the HKSAR government has formally written to the US government requesting clarification on earlier reports about the hacking of computer systems in Hong Kong by US government agencies.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tVans belonging to the Russian presidential administration wait by the Aeroflot plane believed to be carrying Edward Snowden at Moscow airport. Photograph: Mirian Elder\n\t\t\t\n            \nA spokesperson declined to reply to further queries.Snowden is believed to have boarded Aeroflot SU213 on Sunday morning, bound for Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Reuters cited an airline source who said the whistleblower would fly on to Cuba on Monday, before travelling on to Venezuela.Snowden had earlier cited Iceland as a possible refuge in an interview with the Guardian.In a statement, Wikileaks said: \"He is bound for a democratic nation via a safe route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisors from WikiLeaks.\"Mr Snowden requested that WikiLeaks use its legal expertise and experience to secure his safety. Once Mr Snowden arrives at his final destination his request will be formally processed.\"Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said: \"I don't [know if he's planning to stay in Moscow]. I heard about the potential [arrival] from the press. I know nothing.\"On whether Moscow would still consider a request for asylum from Snowden, Peskov added: \"Every application is considered so it's standard procedure \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We are not tracing his movements and I know nothing.\"Simon Young, director of the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, described the news of Snowden's departure as \"a shocker\".He said: \"The US government will be irate with their Hong Kong counterparts [and] may even question whether the Hong Kong government was acting in good faith pursuant to their treaty obligations. I have no doubt that they were, and it is quite common for government lawyers to seek more information on surrender or mutual legal assistance requests before local process can begin.\"But Young noted that given the very low threshold for a provisional warrant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 simply providing evidence that the person was in Hong Kong and that he or she was wanted for prosecution in the US \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Washington \"will wonder why the Hong Kong government feels the surrender paperwork needs to be fully in place before the provisional warrant can be obtained\".The US department of justice was not immediately available for comment and the ministry of foreign affairs in Beijing has yet to comment.Lawyers had said a legal battle over Snowden's surrender from Hong Kong  could have lasted years, but had also warned that in the long run he was unlikely to prove successful.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "NSA whistleblower lands in Russia after Hong Kong allows

Welcome to TV's new old thing", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/21/cbs-under-the-dome-miniseries-tv", "text": "\n\t    There's something totally remarkable about CBS' new show Under the Dome, which premieres Monday, June 24. No, it's not the town stuck under an impenetrable bubble concept (hello, Simpsons Movie), it's that it's only 13 episodes long and it's debuting in the doldrums of the summer. And, shock of all shocks, everyone's calling it a miniseries. What makes this so odd? Well, it's the first of a tide of miniseries projects that the networks are toying with after they became obsolete, and it's in the middle of the summer, traditionally home to \"if you haven't seen it, it's new to you reruns\" and every cheap reality concept from Big Brother to America's Got Talent. This is a Stephen King adaptation written by one of the Lost writers. This is as big as TV gets these days. And this could be the thing that saves network television. In the fall NBC will kick of Dracula, starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers (his pallor isn't from being undead, he's just Irish) a 10-episode \"limited series\", which is what they're calling it to replace that dirty word. ABC is developing a miniseries based on the Aids documentary How to Survive a Plague. \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tUnder the Dome kicks off Monday June 24 \n\t\t\n\tIn 2014 Fox goes whole hog on the concept with not only a revival of show 24 as a 12-episode \"event series\" (which is their answer to renaming the dirty word) but also Wayward Pines whose Twin Peaks-meets-Misery formula has Matt Dillon as an FBI agent in a small town and Melissa Leo as the nurse who tortures him. (M Night Shyamalan is involved but if there's one thing more poisoned in Hollywood than the term \"miniseries\" it's his name). Fox will continue with a whole host of other 13-episodes-or-less projects: Civil War drama Blood Brothers, the self-explanatory The People v OJ Simpson, and a remake of classic miniseries Shogun. Speaking of Shogun, the format was incredibly popular in the 1970s thanks to ABC's Roots, which had 36 million people watching the finale. There was a resurgence in the 90s with fantasy fare like Gulliver's Travels and Merlin, but by the 00s they'd been abandoned everywhere but HBO and cable. But cable might be what is getting the networks back into the game. Hatfields & McCoys scored History Channel 14 million viewers (and five Emmys) last spring. The History Channel scored again with The Bible this year, netting about 12 million viewers. But how can cable hits help the network? Well, they've obviously demonstrated that in our binge-watching, DVR-saturated culture there's some old life in the old girl yet. It also helps cure several of network television's biggest problems. It's easier to sign on big stars and directors for a limited engagement and even networks will take risks on \"event series.\" That helps stave off the growing competition from HBO or cable (which has the Walking Dead, the best rated show on TV in the 18-to-49 demographic that advertisers crave like zombies do brains).     \n                \nNeat packages of complete stories also provides content that is easily sold to Netflix, Hulu, iTunes or any of the other countless redistributors that are making hoards of cash right now. It's hard to make a deal with one of these services for the umpteen seasons of CSI, but tapping into that secondary revenue stream for 10 episodes of a Stephen King show about people under a bubble is a sure bet. And if it becomes a hit there, it only adds more relevance the next time a network decides to air a limited series.Fox is betting so heavily on the strategy so that it can finally become a year-round programmer. You won't see any more reruns in the summer. Instead they'll abandon the September to May schedule that has been with television longer than I Love Lucy and be offering new shows throughout the year, using their \"events\" to plug up the holes in their schedule. It's a smart, bold move, and the first salvo from the networks that they aren't going to take the revolution lying down and fade into irrelevance with their outdated system. That is, of course, unless Under the Dome is a giant flop. Then all bets are off.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Brian Moylan: NBC's planning a 10-episode Dracula series, and ABC is adapting the documentary How to Survive a Plague.

Americans' communication", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant#start-of-comments", "text": "\n\t    Top secret documents submitted to the court that oversees surveillance by US intelligence agencies show the judges have signed off on broad orders which allow the NSA to make use of information \"inadvertently\" collected from domestic US communications without a warrant.The Guardian is publishing in full two documents submitted to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (known as the Fisa court), signed by Attorney General Eric Holder and stamped 29 July 2009. They detail the procedures the NSA is required to follow to target \"non-US persons\" under its foreign intelligence powers and what the agency does to minimize data collected on US citizens and residents in the course of that surveillance.The documents show that even under authorities governing the collection of foreign intelligence from foreign targets, US communications can still be collected, retained and used. The procedures cover only part of the NSA's surveillance of domestic US communications. The bulk collection of domestic call records, as first revealed by the Guardian earlier this month, takes place under rolling court orders issued on the basis of a legal interpretation of a different authority, section 215 of the Patriot Act.The Fisa court's oversight role has been referenced many times by Barack Obama and senior intelligence officials as they have sought to reassure the public about surveillance, but the procedures approved by the court have never before been publicly disclosed.The top secret documents published today detail the circumstances in which data collected on US persons under the foreign intelligence authority must be destroyed, extensive steps analysts must take to try to check targets are outside the US, and reveals how US call records are used to help remove US citizens and residents from data collection.However, alongside those provisions, the Fisa court-approved policies allow the NSA to:\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Keep data that could potentially contain details of US persons for up to five years;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Retain and make use of \"inadvertently acquired\" domestic communications if they contain usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threat of harm to people or property, are encrypted, or are believed to contain any information relevant to cybersecurity;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Preserve \"foreign intelligence information\" contained within attorney-client communications;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Access the content of communications gathered from \"U.S. based machine[s]\" or phone numbers in order to establish if targets are located in the US, for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance.The broad scope of the court orders, and the nature of the procedures set out in the documents, appear to clash with assurances from President Obama and senior intelligence officials that the NSA could not access Americans' call or email information without warrants.The documents also show that discretion as to who is actually targeted under the NSA's foreign surveillance powers lies directly with its own analysts, without recourse to courts or superiors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though a percentage of targeting decisions are reviewed by internal audit teams on a regular basis.Since the Guardian first revealed the extent of the NSA's collection of US communications, there have been repeated calls for the legal basis of the programs to be released. On Thursday, two US congressmen introduced a bill compelling the Obama administration to declassify the secret legal justifications for NSA surveillance.The disclosure bill, sponsored by Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Todd Rokita, an Indiana Republican, is a complement to one proposed in the Senate last week. It would \"increase the transparency of the Fisa Court and the state of the law in this area,\" Schiff told the Guardian. \"It would give the public a better understanding of the safeguards, as well as the scope of these programs.\"Section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act (FAA), which was renewed for five years last December, is the authority under which the NSA is allowed to collect large-scale data, including foreign communications and also communications between the US and other countries, provided the target is overseas.FAA warrants are issued by the Fisa court for up to 12 months at a time, and authorise the collection of bulk information \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of which can include communications of US citizens, or people inside the US. To intentionally target either of those groups requires an individual warrant.One-paragraph orderOne such warrant seen by the Guardian shows that they do not contain detailed legal rulings or explanation. Instead, the one-paragraph order, signed by a Fisa court judge in 2010, declares that the procedures submitted by the attorney general on behalf of the NSA are consistent with US law and the fourth amendment.Those procedures state that the \"NSA determines whether a person is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be outside the United States in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the information available with respect to that person, including information concerning the communications facility or facilities used by that person\".It includes information that the NSA analyst uses to make this determination \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including IP addresses, statements made by the potential target, and other information in the NSA databases, which can include public information and data collected by other agencies.Where the NSA has no specific information on a person's location, analysts are free to presume they are overseas, the document continues.\"In the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States person,\" it states \"a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or whose location is not known will be presumed to be a non-United States person unless such person can be positively identified as a United States person.\"If it later appears that a target is in fact located in the US, analysts are permitted to look at the content of messages, or listen to phone calls, to establish if this is indeed the case.Referring to steps taken to prevent intentional collection of telephone content of those inside the US, the document states: \"NSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a foreign target has entered or intends to enter the United States. Such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic and intelligence requirements and priorities.\"Details set out in the \"minimization procedures\", regularly referred to in House and Senate hearings, as well as public statements in recent weeks, also raise questions as to the extent of monitoring of US citizens and residents.NSA minimization procedures signed by Holder in 2009 set out that once a target is confirmed to be within the US, interception must stop immediately. However, these circumstances do not apply to large-scale data where the NSA claims it is unable to filter US communications from non-US ones.The NSA is empowered to retain data for up to five years and the policy states \"communications which may be retained include electronic communications acquired because of limitations on the NSA's ability to filter communications\".Even if upon examination a communication is found to be domestic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 entirely within the US \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the NSA can appeal to its director to keep what it has found if it contains \"significant foreign intelligence information\", \"evidence of a crime\", \"technical data base information\" (such as encrypted communications), or \"information pertaining to a threat of serious harm to life or property\".Domestic communications containing none of the above must be destroyed. Communications in which one party was outside the US, but the other is a US-person, are permitted for retention under FAA rules.The minimization procedure adds that these can be disseminated to other agencies or friendly governments if the US person is anonymised, or including the US person's identity under certain criteria.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tHolder's 'minimization procedure' says once a target is confirmed to be in the US, interception of communication must stop. Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nA separate section of the same document notes that as soon as any intercepted communications are determined to have been between someone under US criminal indictment and their attorney, surveillance must stop. However, the material collected can be retained, if it is useful, though in a segregated database:\"The relevant portion of the communication containing that conversation will be segregated and the National Security Division of the Department of Justice will be notified so that appropriate procedures may be established to protect such communications from review or use in any criminal prosecution, while preserving foreign intelligence information contained therein,\" the document states.In practice, much of the decision-making appears to lie with NSA analysts, rather than the Fisa court or senior officials.A transcript of a 2008 briefing on FAA from the NSA's general counsel sets out how much discretion NSA analysts possess when it comes to the specifics of targeting, and making decisions on who they believe is a non-US person. Referring to a situation where there has been a suggestion a target is within the US.\"Once again, the standard here is a reasonable belief that your target is outside the United States. What does that mean when you get information that might lead you to believe the contrary? It means you can't ignore it. You can't turn a blind eye to somebody saying: 'Hey, I think so and so is in the United States.' You can't ignore that. Does it mean you have to completely turn off collection the minute you hear that? No, it means you have to do some sort of investigation: 'Is that guy right? Is my target here?\" he says.\"But, if everything else you have says 'no' (he talked yesterday, I saw him on TV yesterday, even, depending on the target, he was in Baghdad) you can still continue targeting but you have to keep that in mind. You can't put it aside. You have to investigate it and, once again, with that new information in mind, what is your reasonable belief about your target's location?\"The broad nature of the court's oversight role, and the discretion given to NSA analysts, sheds light on responses from the administration and internet companies to the Guardian's disclosure of the PRISM program. They have stated that the content of online communications is turned over to the NSA only pursuant to a court order. But except when a US citizen is specifically targeted, the court orders used by the NSA to obtain that information as part of Prism are these general FAA orders, not individualized warrants specific to any individual.Once armed with these general orders, the NSA is empowered to compel telephone and internet companies to turn over to it the communications of any individual identified by the NSA. The Fisa court plays no role in the selection of those individuals, nor does it monitor who is selected by the NSA.The NSA's ability to collect and retain the communications of people in the US, even without a warrant, has fuelled congressional demands for an estimate of how many Americans have been caught up in surveillance.Two US senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both members of the Senate intelligence committee \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have been seeking this information since 2011, but senior White House and intelligence officials have repeatedly insisted that the agency is unable to gather such statistics.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Fisa court submissions show broad scope of procedures governing NSA's surveillance of Americans' communication",

barb", "description": "Maria Sharapova has hit back at Serena Williams after the world No1's interview", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/22/maria-sharapova-serena-williams-wimbledon", "text": "\n\t    The uneasy truce at the top of the women's game was well and truly broken on Saturday as Maria Sharapova laid into the world No1, Serena Williams, in an episode that has added a real spark\u00a0to proceedings on the eve of Wimbledon.There has been a palpable edge between them on court over recent months but the gloves were ripped off when Sharapova said the American should not criticise anyone's private life because her own is far from beyond reproach.In a recent interview with Rolling Stone magazine, the reporter taped Williams as she telephoned her sister, Venus Williams, describing \"a top-five player who is now in love\". The writer of the piece quoted Williams as saying: \"She begins every interview with 'I'm so happy. I'm so lucky' \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's so boring. She's still not going to be invited to the cool parties. And, hey, if she wants to be with the guy with a black heart, go for it'.\"The writer made what he called \"an educated guess\" that Williams was referring to Sharapova, whose boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov, the Bulgarian player, was rumoured to have briefly dated Williams beforehand. It is perfectly possible that Williams could have been referring to Victoria Azarenka, whose boyfriend Redfoo is the son of Berry Gordy, the man who founded the Motown music label, but Sharapova weighed in nevertheless.\"Obviously I have a tremendous amount of respect for Serena and what she's achieved on the court,\" said Sharapova. \"You can never take anything away from that.\"As for myself, or whether it was about somebody else, nothing personal, you know,\" Sharapova began, before dropping the bombshell. \"If she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids. Talk about other things, but [don't] draw attention to other things. She has so much in her life, many positives, and I think that's what it should be about.\"The \"boyfriend\" Sharapova referred to is understood to be Patrick Mouratoglou, the Frenchman who runs his own academy in Paris. Formerly the coach of Britain's Laura Robson, he has coached Williams since last summer. Williams and Mouratoglou have been pictured together many times but have not publicly confirmed their relationship. French journalists said on Saturday he is in the process of getting a divorce.Mouratoglou saidon Saturday: \"I don't think anything about it [about what Sharapova said]. My role is to think about tennis and to help Serena be the best she can be and do what she wants to achieve. I'm just here for tennis.\"If it sounds like something out of Melrose Place, that's probably because it almost is. Dimitrov spent a long time with Mouratoglou at his academy and the Frenchman was also his individual coach for a period. After Williams won the French Open earlier this month, Mouratoglou told reporters that Dimitrov was even responsible for their meeting. \"I met Serena because she was friends with Grigor Dimitrov and I was coaching him,\" he said. \"I would see her at tournaments, they were talking, and we were talking all three a little bit, and that's it.There are a lot of rumours and innuendo to sift through but it is unquestionably true that Sharapova is not someone who is impulsive in press conferences. She rarely loses her temper and she is such a professional that there are very few occasions on which she does not know exactly what she's saying or doing. Unlike Williams, she has never made a public apology for something she has said or done.\"What I do on court and what I talk about in my press conference is strictly about my career,\" Sharapova said. \"I'm sure people want to know more but yet I try to keep my personal life private. Nobody really cares about what I have to say, my opinions. If I speak to my friends, that's one thing. But I don't go out and try to create things that shouldn't be really talked about.\"As they did in Paris, Williams and Sharapova could meet in the final here of the Czech Republic. Williams has won 14 of their 16 meetings and 13 in a row, dating back to 2004, the year when the Russian won Wimbledon. Should they meet again in the final on  6 July, sparks may fly.Azarenka, meanwhile, has been going about her business quietly, with her press conference attracting just five questions. The world No2's take on the Sharapova-Williams spat was effectively a no comment and she is focusing on trying to win the title for the first time. The Czech Petra Kvitova, the champion in 2011, is another danger, but for the moment, it's all about Williams and Sharapova.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Maria Sharapova has hit

northern India, with tens of thousands of people still missing and entire villages destroyed. More heavy rain is forecast.Rescue efforts involving 12,000 soldiers are continuing, and more than 50 air force helicopters have been dropping food, water and medical supplies to people trapped by the water in the foothills of the Himalayas. Others are airlifting survivors where they can be reached.Tourists and pilgrims have been caught up in the disaster in Uttarakhand, a holy place for Hindus, where tens of thousands had been visiting ahead of the expected arrival of the rainy season. Many people have been stranded for five days in what the Indian government has called a \"national disaster\".The flooding, which began almost a week ago with the heaviest rainfall this area has seen in 60 years, has worsened steadily with houses and blocks of flats on the banks of the Ganges, India's longest river, toppling into the torrent and being swept away with cars, trucks and even bridges.Smaller streams have burst their banks, making hill passes inaccessible and smaller mountain roads have simply disappeared in the flooding.According to government officials, at least 33,000 people have been rescued so far and around 63,000 are missing, 40,000 of them pilgrims. Home minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who arrived in the Uttarakhand capital of Dehradun to review rescue efforts, said operations are now on a war footing to evacuate the stranded. The railways are running special trains from the devastated areas to take survivors home.\"Whatever is humanly possible is being done,\" said Manish Tewari, the minister of information and broadcasting. The rains eased  on Saturdaybut more heavy rain is expected from  Sunday onwards, meaning that rescuers face a narrowing window of opportunity to reach the stranded.\"So far, 575 bodies have been recovered, but the toll is likely to go up. As per our records, 62,790 people are still stranded,\" said Uttarakhand's home secretary, Om Prakash, on Saturday. He said an eight-strong team of doctors and officials had been sent to the Hindu pilgrimage site of Kedarnath temple \"to collect the bodies lying there\".\"This kind of disaster has never happened in Himalayan history,\" said one official. Some local people are complaining of neglect from relief agencies, alleging priority is being given to the tourists and Hindu pilgrims but, while the authorities have admitted to poor co-ordination of the rescue effort, the army is struggling to repair roads and bridges to reach more remote areas.The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has called the situation \"distressing\" and offered 200,000 rupees (\u00c2\u00a32,000) to each family of those who have lost their lives, plus 50,000 rupees (\u00c2\u00a3400) to the injured from his national relief fund. He also pledged money to people who have lost their homes.The rains have spared the summer sowing season in northern India, as planting of rice, sugar, cotton and other agricultural produce is not yet in full swing. Heavy rain early in the June-September season makes planting easier, but if flooding persists stagnant water can delay sowing or damage rice shoots.Floods and landslides from monsoon rains have also hit neighbouring Nepal, killing at least 39 people, the Nepalese government said.Google has opened up its person-finder tool in Hindi and English to help trace missing people in Uttarakhand. India's National Disaster Management Authority has published control room phone numbers for the flood-affected districts.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Pilgrims and tourists caught

unemployment and call on Enrico Letta's two-month-old government to deliver more than empty rhetoric on the issue.The rally, organised by the country's three largest unions was the first major protest since Letta's broad, left-right coalition took office following an inconclusive election in February.Italian unemployment rose to 12% in April, the highest level on record, and joblessness among people under 24 is at an all-time high above 40%.Union chiefs, speaking before a flag-waving crowd estimated at more than 100,000 by the organisers, criticised Letta for what they called a lack of action on an urgent problem.\"We can't accept these continuous promises that aren't translated into decisions that give a change of direction,\" said Susanna Camusso, leader of the country's largest union CGIL.Luigi Angeletti, head of the UIL, said the country could not afford the piecemeal approach to policy adopted so far, especially when the ruling coalition is so fragile.\"In a country where the main concern is betting on how long the government will last, the message is that there is no more time for promises and announcements,\" he said in Piazza San Giovanni, the traditional venue of leftwing protests.Letta's cabinet is due to unveil a package aimed at tackling youth unemployment next week, but Angeletti said the measures being mooted, such as tax breaks for firms hiring young people, were useless.Italy's economy has contracted in every quarter since mid-2011 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 its longest post-war recession \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and companies are steadily shedding staff.The unionists called on the government to intervene to prevent plans by white-goods manufacturer Indesit to lay off 1,400 workers in one of the most recent labour disputes.\"Indesit isn't in crisis, it just wants to use its profits to make investments in Turkey and Poland,\" Camusso said.One marcher, Lorenzo Giuseppe, said he had turned out \"to send a message to the government that jobs have to be the top issue on the agenda. If we have work we can move ahead.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Union chiefs address an 100,000-strong crowd, criticising Prime Minster Enrico Letta for a lack of tangible

\"political asylum in a democratic country\" there was one detail that apparently confirmed its involvement \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that Snowden was travelling with a person whose surname was Harrison.Sarah Harrison \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who WikiLeaks on Sunday published an updated biography for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has been a staff member for more than two years, and is one of Julian Assange's closest advisors.She began her involvement with the group when as an intern at the UK-based Centre for Investigative Journalism, she was assigned to Assange ahead of WikiLeaks' publication of the Afghan war logs. As several key members, including Assange's number-two Daniel Domscheit-Berg and several of his associates, left in a dispute with Assange, she became more important to WikiLeaks and was closely involved in the publication of the embassy cables and with Assange's personal legal battles to avoid extradition to Sweden. She has been pictured on numerous occasions attending court with the WikiLeaks founder.Despite her closeness to Assange, Harrison may seem a strange choice to accompany Snowden, as unlike several people close to WikiLeaks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 most notably human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Harrison has no legal qualifications or background.Julian Assange has made several public statements in support of Edward Snowden and told reporters last week he had been in touch with the whistleblower through intermediaries.The direct intervention in Snowden's situation marks a departure in practice for WikiLeaks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which has previously stressed its arms-length relationship with sources \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but is consistent with the organisation's world view on protecting and supporting whistleblowers.Snowden's intended destination, his plans once he gets there, and whether WikiLeaks intends to play a longer-term role supporting or working with Snowden are not yet known.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Sarah Harrison revealed as the WikiLeaks staffer accompanying NSA whistleblower on journey to 'democratic country'",

Here are the results \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0a fairly eclectic top ten, with some leftfield choices alongside the blockbusters you'd expect to see do well in a public vote. We've included some supporting statements from our esteemed voters, along with links to our reviews of the films. Disagree with the results? Perturbed by the absence of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters? Let us know in the thread below.10. Man of Steel    \n                \n\"Finally showed what fighting with superpowers could be like. Also a more adult take on superheroes\" Chris Dor\u00c3\u00a9\"I thought matching the Richard Donner film was an impossible task but I was wrong.\" Kevin O'ConnorRead the Guardian review9. Spring Breakers    \n                \n\"A bold, visually dazzling, provocative, hilarious and moving film that confirms Harmony Korine as the most important filmmaker of his generation.\" Daniel Hickin\"A topography of young people's minds, a secret treasure map revealing hidden desires and mutated G-Spots of the 21st century.\" Johannes LehnenRead the Guardian review8. Iron Man 3    \n                \n \"Hilarious, clever, non-stop entertainment that had me grinning throughout.\" Louise Crane\"Its dark, funny and clever. My kids love Iron Man and its strikes a perfect balance for a superhero film.\" Paul HealyRead the Guardian review7. Behind the Candelabra    \n                \n\"Michael Douglas is superb \u00e2\u0080\u0093 touching and believable. So glad the British have given it the credit it deserves by screening  the film in cinemas, unlike the American film industry.\" Izzie B\"Quite simply, it's everything you want in a good film. It looks stunning, has top-notch performances all round, contains real laugh out loud moments as well as being really quite unexpectedly moving. Plus add on top of that sequins, Matt Damon in a speedo and Rob Lowe's face and you have not just a good film, but a great one.\" CaitlinRead the Guardian review6. Stoker    \n                \n\"One of the most beautiful films of the year and in fact one of the most beautiful of Park Chan-Wook's career. Matthew Goode's subtly macabre turn had me leave the cinema with a nasty taste in my mouth that I am yet to get rid of and don't think I will lose for the rest of the year. It's sublime film making.\" Saul Allerton\"Definitely a film for multiple viewings, the banality of evil sprinkled with angel dust, that's entertainment.\" Stephen LucasRead the Guardian review5. Mud    \n                \n\"It's Shane meets Stand by Me.\" John Fitzgerald\"It's Americana, coming of age, loss of innocence all rolled into one. Great performances throughout including the continuing revival of McConaughey's career.  It confirms Jeff Nichols as the director to watch.\" Carl Albanese\"It's beguiling, beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, moving, deeply human, and full of exquisite cinematic moments.\" RupertRead the Guardian review4. Star Trek Into Darkness    \n                \n\"A wonderful summer blockbuster with action, suspense, and heart. This year's Avengers.\" Sam Jones\"As a something of an art house cinema lover, I was completely surprised and blown away by this audio visual extravaganza. I had been very sceptical of all this 3D business but couldn't have enjoyed this more. A rip roaring thrill ride that made me completely forget about real life for a couple of hours. Precisely what good entertainment should do.\" Allan Bain\"What a delight to see a Hollywood movie present judicial process \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rather than rampaging revenge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as the correct measure to take against a homeland attack.\" Will StrangeRead the Guardian review3. The Great Gatsby    \n                \n\"A fresh and original take on a classic that has never translated particularly well to the big screen. An unexpected triumph, with superb performances and a soundtrack that is mostly thrilling.\" Stephen Lawlor\"This is a great film. At long last, Luhrmann has achieved his magnum opus.\" Michael Carmichael\"Amazingly cinematic. Baz gives the tale a Shakespearian heft and universality instead of falling into the trap of making a costume drama.\" William MalcomsonRead the Guardian review2. The Place Beyond The Pines    \n                \n\"Innovative, thorough, painful, Shakespearean, great performances.\" Ricardo Vargas\"When a film surprises you, grabs you whole, entices you, and moves you this much, it must be exceptional. You even love its faults. Lovely!\" Hannu Bj\u00c3\u00b6rkbacka\"An epic drama with wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper and of course the man himself Ryan Gosling. Great father son relationship study.\" akbarRead the Guardian review1. Django Unchained    \n                \n\"Tarantino's most complete film since Pulp Fiction, it rises above mere homage to become a classic Western in its own right. Samuel L. Jackson, Leonardo Di Caprio and Jamire Foxx have never been better, and Christoph Waltz is even better than them.\" Doug Scott\"Excellent acting, fantastic soundtrack, perfect direction, engrossing adventure. Totally mesmerized from start to finish.\" Matthew Atherton\"Disturbing, terrifying, hilarious, uncompromising.\" Gemma O'Donnell\"Far and away the best movie of 2013. From soundtrack to cinematography to the outstanding performances of the actors to Quenten's unique blend of ultra violence and op\u00c3\u00a9ra bouffe, Django is an exploding horse head of film magic, fabulous music and just deserts, destined to be a classic.\" Sean MalloyRead the Guardian review\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "We may only be half way through, but 2013 is shaping up to be a great year for films.

Masasit Mati, creators of the YouTube finger-puppet show Top Goon: Diaries of a Little Dictator, have begun to perform the satirical series live inside the war-torn country in an attempt to bolster peaceful protest and spur the revolutionary art movement.The series, which will be shown in London next month as part of the Shubbak festival of Arab culture, caricatures Assad through the puppet Beeshu, the brutal, childish son of a dictator with a beaky nose and saucer-shaped ears. He is protected by his sinister and unquestioning henchman, The Goon, while ordinary Syrians are portrayed as brave and idealistic.Speaking via Skype from Lebanon, the show's director, Jameel, said they decided to use puppets to protect the identities of the 10 artists involved and because their small size \"was a good way of lampooning the regime that presents itself as godlike\".The episodes were filmed in Beirut, with the puppets and props smuggled out by the artists. \"We disguised the puppets, especially the one of Beeshu,\" said Jameel. \"We gave him a moustache and extra hair. Otherwise, everyone would have recognised him.\"The first series, launched in autumn 2011, attracted more than 200,000 views on YouTube and was broadcast on the Dubai-based Syrian opposition channel Orient TV. But escalating violence and power blackouts shrank the domestic audience for the second and third series. So in January the group surreptitiously travelled into the rebel-held town of Manbij in the northern region of Aleppo to perform live in an arts festival organised by local activists. The town had enjoyed relative calm for a month, with no attacks or kidnappings, but on the day they arrived it was bombed by Assad's forces, leaving 12 dead and dozens more wounded.\"We were very shocked and the organisers of the festival thought it should be delayed,\" said Jameel. \"We felt we couldn't wait another week, but we didn't want to gather people indoors in case there was another air strike. So we performed some of the episodes in the street during a protest [about the bombings].\"Top Goon draws on Assad's speeches and biased state TV coverage of the uprising to highlight and subvert the regime's propaganda.In the episode Prostitute Media, a protester is forced to confess to being a violent criminal on an official news programme, saying: \"I held an olive branch in my hand ... I mean I was holding an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade], a nuclear bomb, pistols, rifles I got from al-Qaida.\"The series has also been critical of the armed resistance. In the episode Monster, Beeshu tortures a protester and taunts him to take his revenge. The prisoner attacks and strangles the dictator, who then gloats: \"I told you, you're a monster, just like me.\"Jameel said the live performance was \"also about testing out the boundaries of the new regime in the liberated areas\". He added: \"It's one of the regions suffering now from the temptations of the Islamists and sectarianism. We were apprehensive about how they would react to one actress \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hearing the voice of a lady who was making fun of a famous singer with this kind of sexy voice. But we felt very welcomed and respected.\"The group is preparing for live performances in Aleppo and the northern regions, which it hopes will support local artists. Arts committees and newspapers have been set up in rebel areas, but some have been shut down by hardline elements of the Free Syrian Army.\"There's a whole civil society that's being ignored by activists and the western and Arab media,\" said Jameel. \"We're trying to come up with a concept of street theatre where we'll go to an area, put on a show, then teach the people how to make puppets and put on shows. What keeps people alive is bringing them hope.\"Top Goon is showing in Culture in Defiance at the Rich Mix arts centre in Shoreditch, east London, from 4-13 July.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Masasit Mati launched the online show Top Goon in 2011 to lampoon Assad.

Snowden", "description": "Charges include theft of government property and unauthorised communication of national defence information", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/22/us-charging-edward-snowden-with-espionage", "text": "\n\t    The US has filed espionage charges against the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and reports say authorities have requested that Hong Kong detain him for extradition. Legislators in Hong Kong responded by calling for mainland China to intervene in the case. Snowden, 29, is charged with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorised person, according to court documents.Snowden is reported to be in hiding in Hong Kong. The Washington Post said the US had asked the autonomous Chinese territory to detain the former NSA contractor on a provisional arrest warrent, while other reports cited US officials as saying preparations were being made to seek his extradition.One Hong Kong legislator, Leung Kwok-hung, said Beijing should instruct Hong Kong to protect Snowden from extradition before the case was dragged through the court system. Leung also urged the people of Hong Kong to \"take to the streets to protect Snowden\". Another lawmaker, Cyd Ho, vice-chair of the pro-democracy Labour party, said China \"should now make its stance clear to the Hong Kong SAR [special administrative region] government\". US prosecutors have 60 days to file an indictment and can then take steps to secure Snowden's extradition from Hong Kong for a criminal trial in the US. Snowden would be able to challenge the request for his extradition in court in Hong Kong.The US extradition treaty with Hong Kong has an exception for political offences, which might include espionage.Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic businessman linked to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, said on Thursday he had readied a private plane in China to fly Snowden to Iceland if Iceland's government would grant asylum. Iceland refused on Friday to say whether it would grant asylum to Snowden.The complaint against Snowden was filed at the federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia where  Snowden's former employer, government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, is headquartered. The complaint is dated 14 June, five days after Snowden was first revealed as the leaker.The US and Hong Kong have a standing agreement on the surrender of fugitives. However, Snowden's appeal rights could drag out any extradition proceeding. The success or failure also depends on what the suspect is charged with under US law and how it corresponds to Hong Kong law. In order for Hong Kong officials to honour the extradition request they have to have some applicable statute under their law that corresponds with a violation of US law.Advocacy organisation the Government Accountability Project said Snowden should be shielded from prosecution by whistleblower protection laws. \"He disclosed information about a secret programme that he reasonably believed to be illegal, and his actions alone brought about the long-overdue national debate about the proper balance between privacy and civil liberties, on the one hand, and national security on the other,\" the group said in a statement.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Charges include theft of government property and unauthorised communication of national defence information", "freqs":

latest documents from Edward Snowden\u2026", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa", "text": "\n\t    Britain's spy agency GCHQ has secretly gained access to the network of cables which carry the world's phone calls and internet traffic and has started to process vast streams of sensitive personal information which it is sharing with its American partner, the National Security Agency (NSA).The sheer scale of the agency's ambition is reflected in the titles of its two principal components: Mastering the Internet and Global Telecoms Exploitation, aimed at scooping up as much online and telephone traffic as possible. This is all being carried out without any form of public acknowledgement or debate.One key innovation has been GCHQ's ability to tap into and store huge volumes of data drawn from fibre-optic cables for up to 30 days so that it can be sifted and analysed. That operation, codenamed Tempora, has been running for some 18 months.GCHQ and the NSA are consequently able to access and process vast quantities of communications between entirely innocent people, as well as targeted suspects.This includes recordings of phone calls, the content of email messages, entries on Facebook and the history of any internet user's access to websites \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of which is deemed legal, even though the warrant system was supposed to limit interception to a specified range of targets.The existence of the programme has been disclosed in documents shown to the Guardian by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden as part of his attempt to expose what he has called \"the largest programme of suspicionless surveillance in human history\".\"It's not just a US problem. The UK has a huge dog in this fight,\" Snowden told the Guardian. \"They [GCHQ] are worse than the US.\"However, on Friday a source with knowledge of intelligence argued that the data was collected legally under a system of safeguards, and had provided material that had led to significant breakthroughs in detecting and preventing serious crime.Britain's technical capacity to tap into the cables that carry the world's communications \u00e2\u0080\u0093 referred to in the documents as special source exploitation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has made GCHQ an intelligence superpower.By 2010, two years after the project was first trialled, it was able to boast it had the \"biggest internet access\" of any member of the Five Eyes electronic eavesdropping alliance, comprising the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.UK officials could also claim GCHQ \"produces larger amounts of metadata than NSA\". (Metadata describes basic information on who has been contacting whom, without detailing the content.)By May last year 300 analysts from GCHQ, and 250 from the NSA, had been assigned to sift through the flood of data.The Americans were given guidelines for its use, but were told in legal briefings by GCHQ lawyers: \"We have a light oversight regime compared with the US\".When it came to judging the necessity and proportionality of what they were allowed to look for, would-be American users were told it was \"your call\".The Guardian understands that a total of 850,000 NSA employees and US private contractors with top secret clearance had access to GCHQ databases.The documents reveal that by last year GCHQ was handling 600m \"telephone events\" each day, had tapped more than 200 fibre-optic cables and was able to process data from at least 46 of them at a time.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tDocument quoting Lt Gen Keith Alexander, head of the NSA, during a visit to Britain\n\t\t\t\n            \nEach of the cables carries data at a rate of 10 gigabits per second, so the tapped cables had the capacity, in theory, to deliver more than 21 petabytes a day \u00e2\u0080\u0093 equivalent to sending all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours.And the scale of the programme is constantly increasing as more cables are tapped and GCHQ data storage facilities in the UK and abroad are expanded with the aim of processing terabits (thousands of gigabits) of data at a time.For the 2 billion users of the world wide web, Tempora represents a window on to their everyday lives, sucking up every form of communication from the fibre-optic cables that ring the world.The NSA has meanwhile opened a second window, in the form of the Prism operation, revealed earlier this month by the Guardian, from which it secured access to the internal systems of global companies that service the internet.The GCHQ mass tapping operation has been built up over five years by attaching intercept probes to transatlantic fibre-optic cables where they land on British shores carrying data to western Europe from telephone exchanges and internet servers in north America.This was done under secret agreements with commercial companies, described in one document as \"intercept partners\".The papers seen by the Guardian suggest some companies have been paid for the cost of their co-operation and GCHQ went to great lengths to keep their names secret. They were assigned \"sensitive relationship teams\" and staff were urged in one internal guidance paper to disguise the origin of \"special source\" material in their reports for fear that the role of the companies as intercept partners would cause \"high-level political fallout\".The source with knowledge of intelligence said on Friday the companies were obliged to co-operate in this operation. They are forbidden from revealing the existence of warrants compelling them to allow GCHQ access to the cables.\"There's an overarching condition of the licensing of the companies that they have to co-operate in this. Should they decline, we can compel them to do so. They have no choice.\"The source said that although GCHQ was collecting a \"vast haystack of data\" what they were looking for was \"needles\".\"Essentially, we have a process that allows us to select a small number of needles in a haystack. We are not looking at every piece of straw. There are certain triggers that allow you to discard or not examine a lot of data so you are just looking at needles. If you had the impression we are reading millions of emails, we are not. There is no intention in this whole programme to use it for looking at UK domestic traffic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 British people talking to each other,\" the source said.He explained that when such \"needles\" were found a log was made and the interception commissioner could see that log.\"The criteria are security, terror, organised crime. And economic well-being. There's an auditing process to go back through the logs and see if it was justified or not. The vast majority of the data is discarded without being looked at\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we simply don't have the resources.\"However, the legitimacy of the operation is in doubt. According to GCHQ's legal advice, it was given the go-ahead by applying old law to new technology. The 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) requires the tapping of defined targets to be authorised by a warrant signed by the home secretary or foreign secretary.However, an obscure clause allows the foreign secretary to sign a certificate for the interception of broad categories of material, as long as one end of the monitored communications is abroad. But the nature of modern fibre-optic communications means that a proportion of internal UK traffic is relayed abroad and then returns through the cables.Parliament passed the Ripa law to allow GCHQ to trawl for information, but it did so 13 years ago with no inkling of the scale on which GCHQ would attempt to exploit the certificates, enabling it to gather and process data regardless of whether it belongs to identified targets.The categories of material have included fraud, drug trafficking and terrorism, but the criteria at any one time are secret and are not subject to any public debate. GCHQ's compliance with the certificates is audited by the agency itself, but the results of those audits are also secret.An indication of how broad the dragnet can be was laid bare in advice from GCHQ's lawyers, who said it would be impossible to list the total number of people targeted because \"this would be an infinite list which we couldn't manage\".There is an investigatory powers tribunal to look into complaints that the data gathered by GCHQ has been improperly used, but the agency reassured NSA analysts in the early days of the programme, in 2009: \"So far they have always found in our favour\".Historically, the spy agencies have intercepted international communications by focusing on microwave towers and satellites. The NSA's intercept station at Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire played a leading role in this. One internal document quotes the head of the NSA, Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, on a visit to Menwith Hill in June 2008, asking: \"Why can't we collect all the signals all the time? Sounds like a good summer project for Menwith.\"By then, however, satellite interception accounted for only a small part of the network traffic. Most of it now travels on fibre-optic cables, and the UK's position on the western edge of Europe gave it natural access to cables emerging from the Atlantic.The data collected provides a powerful tool in the hands of the security agencies, enabling them to sift for evidence of serious crime. According to the source, it has allowed them to discover new techniques used by terrorists to avoid security checks and to identify terrorists planning atrocities. It has also been used against child exploitation networks and in the field of cyberdefence.It was claimed on Friday that it directly led to the arrest and imprisonment of a cell in the Midlands who were planning co-ordinated attacks; to the arrest of five Luton-based individuals preparing acts of terror, and to the arrest of three London-based people planning attacks prior to the Olympics.As the probes began to generate data, GCHQ set up a three-year trial at the GCHQ station in Bude, Cornwall. By the summer of 2011, GCHQ had probes attached to more than 200 internet links, each carrying data at 10 gigabits a second. \"This is a massive amount of data!\" as one internal slideshow put it. That summer, it brought NSA analysts into the Bude trials. In the autumn of 2011, it launched Tempora as a mainstream programme, shared with the Americans.The intercept probes on the transatlantic cables gave GCHQ access to its special source exploitation. Tempora allowed the agency to set up internet buffers so it could not simply watch the data live but also store it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for three days in the case of content and 30 days for metadata.\"Internet buffers represent an exciting opportunity to get direct access to enormous amounts of GCHQ's special source data,\" one document explained.The processing centres apply a series of sophisticated computer programmes in order to filter the material through what is known as MVR \u00e2\u0080\u0093 massive volume reduction. The first filter immediately rejects high-volume, low-value traffic, such as peer-to-peer downloads, which reduces the volume by about 30%. Others pull out packets of information relating to \"selectors\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 search terms including subjects, phone numbers and email addresses of interest. Some 40,000 of these were chosen by GCHQ and 31,000 by the NSA. Most of the information extracted is \"content\", such as recordings of phone calls or the substance of email messages. The rest is metadata.The GCHQ documents that the Guardian has seen illustrate a constant effort to build up storage capacity at the stations at Cheltenham, Bude and at one overseas location, as well a search for ways to maintain the agency's comparative advantage as the world's leading communications companies increasingly route their cables through Asia to cut costs. Meanwhile, technical work is ongoing to expand GCHQ's capacity to ingest data from new super cables carrying data at 100 gigabits a second. As one training slide told new users: \"You are in an enviable position \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have fun and make the most of it.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Exclusive: British spy

above New York City, it said on Friday.A Delta Airlines Boeing 747, coming in to land at New York's JFK airport, came within half a mile of a Shuttle America flight which was taking off from La Guardia, the FAA said in a statement.The aircraft had \"lost the required separation\" that aeroplanes must have from one another in the air, the agency said. Both planes ultimately landed safely.\"The FAA is investigating an incident on June 13 at 2.40pm, in which Delta Airlines Boeing 747 arriving at JFK's Runway 4L lost the required amount of separation with a Shuttle America Embraer E170 departing from LaGuardia's Runway 13,\" the FAA said. \"The two aircraft were turning away from each other at the point where they lost the required separation. Both aircraft landed safely.\"An FAA source said that in the airspace where the incident occurred the required separation for aircraft is 1,000ft above or below one another and 1,000ft from wingtip to wingtip. The \"nose to tail\" required separation between aircraft is three miles, the source said.The situation arose when the pilot of the Delta flight made a decision not to complete his landing on runway 4L at JFK. This is a standard procedure known as a \"missed approach\". NYC Aviation, a trusted aviation news website which reconstructed the near miss from flight radar data and control tower audio, said that normally in that situation the pilot would bank to the right and circle back for another attempt. In this case the pilot of a flight just ahead of the Delta Boeing 747 had also aborted his landing. This meant the Delta flight could not also bank right, for fear of coming too close to the aircraft ahead.Instead the Delta flight was ordered left by the JFK control tower, before then banking right. This brought the Delta flight into the path of the Shuttle America Embraer E170, which had just taken off from La Guardia.NYC Aviation told the story of the briefly dramatic exchange between the pilot of the Delta Boeing 747 and the JFK control tower.JFK tower asks Delta 172, \"Are you turning?\" Delta 172 responds \"Uh, yes sir, we're almost at 040 now.\" Immediately after, the JFK tower controller gets back on the radio and states \"Delta 172 heavy, traffic 12 o'clock, 1400 feet, Embraer at 1600 feet,\" with a tone of important in his voice. Delta 172 replies \"Ok, we got them on the fish finder here,\" referring to the traffic collision avoidance system. \"OK, he's eastbound at 1800 feet climbing out of ZULAV.\" At this moment, the two aircraft were at virtually the same altitude, headed for each other. However, all parties involved knew of the conflicting traffic, and both aircraft were actively turning to avoid each other. Delta turning to the right, Shuttle America to the left.With the TCAS alarm sounding in the background, Delta 172 gets back on the radio and says \"OK, we're turning right to 060.\" JFK tower then assigns a heading of 180, and Delta 172 is heading south to re-enter the approach pattern. Just like that, it's over. Shuttle America 5981 continues on to Jacksonville, and Delta 172 circles back to JFK and lands safely. \n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Two aeroplanes lost 'required separation' as

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/22/snowden-espionage-charges", "text": "\n\t    The US government has charged Edward Snowden with three felonies, including two under the Espionage Act, the 1917 statute enacted to criminalize dissent against World War I. My priority at the moment is working on our next set of stories, so I just want to briefly note a few points about this.Prior to Barack Obama's inauguration, there were a grand total of three prosecutions of leakers under the Espionage Act (including the prosecution of Dan Ellsberg by the Nixon DOJ). That's because the statute is so broad that even the US government has largely refrained from using it. But during the Obama presidency, there are now seven such prosecutions: more than double the number under all prior US presidents combined. How can anyone justify that? For a politician who tried to convince Americans to elect him based on repeated pledges of unprecedented transparency and specific vows to protect \"noble\" and \"patriotic\" whistleblowers, is this unparalleled assault on those who enable investigative journalism remotely defensible? Recall that the New Yorker's Jane Mayer said recently that this oppressive climate created by the Obama presidency has brought investigative journalism to a \"standstill\", while James Goodale, the General Counsel for the New York Times during its battles with the Nixon administration, wrote last month in that paper that \"President Obama will surely pass President Richard Nixon as the worst president ever on issues of national security and press freedom.\" Read what Mayer and Goodale wrote and ask yourself: is the Obama administration's threat to the news-gathering process not a serious crisis at this point?Few people - likely including Snowden himself - would contest that his actions constitute some sort of breach of the law. He made his choice based on basic theories of civil disobedience: that those who control the law have become corrupt, that the law in this case (by concealing the actions of government officials in building this massive spying apparatus in secret) is a tool of injustice, and that he felt compelled to act in violation of it in order to expose these official bad acts and enable debate and reform.But that's a far cry from charging Snowden, who just turned 30 yesterday, with multiple felonies under the Espionage Act that will send him to prison for decades if not life upon conviction. In what conceivable sense are Snowden's actions \"espionage\"? He could have - but chose not - sold the information he had to a foreign intelligence service for vast sums of money, or covertly passed it to one of America's enemies, or worked at the direction of a foreign government. That is espionage. He did none of those things.What he did instead was give up his life of career stability and economic prosperity, living with his long-time girlfriend in Hawaii, in order to inform his fellow citizens (both in America and around the world) of what the US government and its allies are doing to them and their privacy. He did that by very carefully selecting which documents he thought should be disclosed and concealed, then gave them to a newspaper with a team of editors and journalists and repeatedly insisted that journalistic judgments be exercised about which of those documents should be published in the public interest and which should be withheld. That's what every single whistleblower and source for investigative journalism, in every case, does - by definition. In what conceivable sense does that merit felony charges under the Espionage Act? The essence of that extremely broad, century-old law is that one is guilty if one discloses classified information \"with intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\". Please read this rather good summary in this morning's New York Times of the worldwide debate Snowden has enabled - how these disclosures have \"set off a national debate over the proper limits of government surveillance\" and \"opened an unprecedented window on the details of surveillance by the NSA, including its compilation of logs of virtually all telephone calls in the United States and its collection of e-mails of foreigners from the major American Internet companies, including Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple and Skype\" - and ask yourself: has Snowden actually does anything to bring \"injury to the United States\", or has he performed an immense public service?The irony is obvious: the same people who are building a ubiquitous surveillance system to spy on everyone in the world, including their own citizens, are now accusing the person who exposed it of \"espionage\". It seems clear that the people who are actually bringing \"injury to the United States\" are those who are waging war on basic tenets of transparency and secretly constructing a mass and often illegal and unconstitutional surveillance apparatus aimed at American citizens - and those who are lying to the American people and its Congress about what they're doing - rather than those who are devoted to informing the American people that this is being done.The Obama administration leaks classified information continuously. They do it to glorify the President, or manipulate public opinion, or even to help produce a pre-election propaganda film about the Osama bin Laden raid. The Obama administration does not hate unauthorized leaks of classified information. They are more responsible for such leaks than anyone.What they hate are leaks that embarrass them or expose their wrongdoing. Those are the only kinds of leaks that are prosecuted. It's a completely one-sided and manipulative abuse of secrecy laws. It's all designed to ensure that the only information we as citizens can learn is what they want us to learn because it makes them look good. The only leaks they're interested in severely punishing are those that undermine them politically. The \"enemy\" they're seeking to keep ignorant with selective and excessive leak prosecutions are not The Terrorists or The Chinese Communists. It's the American people. The Terrorists already knew, and have long known, that the US government is doing everything possible to surveil their telephonic and internet communications. The Chinese have long known, and have repeatedly said, that the US is hacking into both their governmental and civilian systems (just as the Chinese are doing to the US). The Russians have long known that the US and UK try to intercept the conversations of their leaders just as the Russians do to the US and the UK.They haven't learned anything from these disclosures that they didn't already well know. The people who have learned things they didn't already know are American citizens who have no connection to terrorism or foreign intelligence, as well as hundreds of millions of citizens around the world about whom the same is true. What they have learned is that the vast bulk of this surveillance apparatus is directed not at the Chinese or Russian governments or the Terrorists, but at them. And that is precisely why the US government is so furious and will bring its full weight to bear against these disclosures. What has been \"harmed\" is not the national security of the US but the ability of its political leaders to work against their own citizens and citizens around the world in the dark, with zero transparency or real accountability. If anything is a crime, it's that secret, unaccountable and deceitful behavior: not the shining of light on it.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Glenn Greenwald: Who is actually

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/23/afghanistan-women", "text": "\n\t    Read the media coverage of the Taliban's office in Qatar, and you could be forgiven for assuming that this is the first time that the group had entered diplomatic talks. Of course some of the features here are new: the luxurious office building, the raising of the flag and so on.But if you look more closely at the nature of the talks, nothing has really changed. The US and its allies were already in contact with the Taliban before the opening of the office, the Pakistani establishment is still playing an important role, and the Afghan government's commitment still keeps on wavering.I view the Taliban's political office not as a new or game-changing event. From Afghan experiences over the past decades, one can foresee that there will be a deal to bring them into the system one way or another. The key question is: will such a deal result in sustainable and inclusive peace and stability all over Afghanistan?The answer I see for such a question so far is not entirely positive. If I am pessimistic, it is because there are still many unresolved internal conflicts, and because there has been a failure to ensure stronger rule of law across the country by putting a real end to impunity. There are also external factors that dampen my optimism: Afghanistan's neighbours near and far have plenty of political, resource-related and strategic interests in maintaining a level of chaos in the country.Afghanistan's future continues to be in the hands of the international community. The stakes are high, and the risk of mishandling the situation is high: direct intervention has proved a failure in the past, but complete abandonment by the world too has resulted in leaving the country in the hands of regional powers and, hence, chaos.Afghan women's struggle for their rights is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 contrary to claims by many \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just a struggle of the recent decade. It is a fight the women of Afghanistan have been engaged in over the past century. The shape of this struggle has differed in each phase of the history, but one thing that is certain is that the struggle will undoubtedly continue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of the shape the country's future will take.Women in Afghanistan are well aware that their involvement in political decision-making is very vulnerable and easily used as a bargaining chip. Yet it is crucial for the world, the government of Afghanistan and its political opponents to realise that no real and sustainable peace can be achieved in this country if the demands, concerns and needs of half of the population are ignored or locked behind closed doors. Afghan women are not looking for symbolic representation, but a more meaningful part in any negotiations and bargaining that happens in their country.It has never been just the Taliban who have felt threatened by women in politics. The recent opposition to the law on  elimination of violence against women (Evaw) in the Afghan parliament highlights this fact. There is no doubt that the Taliban have been rightly marked out for their unreasonable hostility towards women \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which above all contradicts the fundamental principles of Islam. Yet other forces believe that the empowerment of women will result in their own disempowerment. These forces can be found within the current government and beyond that..Those who want a non-violent resolution to the ongoing must realise that there can be no return to the past. If they want to create a future for Afghanistan, it cannot be based on the subordination of women. Instead, it is crucial for all parties involved in the current conflict to ensure the protection of women and children as the most basic and fundamental rule of engagement during conflict. Second, they should frankly state their position on the status of women, particularly with regard to health, education, access to justice and above all political representation.\n    ", "og:type":

mystery", "description": "Company cries foul over appearance of genetically modified wheat plants but scientist who found them doubts claim of sabotage", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/22/agriculture-oregon-monsanto-gm-wheat#start-of-comments", "text": "\n\t    It is a mystery that could cost the American farmer billions: how rogue genetically modified wheat plants turned up on a farmer's field in Oregon.The scientist who first discovered the renegade grain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by dipping a plastic strip into a tube of pulped plant, in order to check its genetics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 believes the GM wheat could have entered America's food supply undetected years ago, and could still be in circulation.\"There's a lot of potential for how it could have got into the supply,\" said Carol Mallory-Smith, a professor of weed sciences at Oregon State University. \"It could have already been processed. It could have gone for animal feed somewhere or it could have gone for something else. It could have gone for storage.\"The Department of Agriculture, which is conducting a secretive investigation into the renegade GM wheat outbreak, maintains the GM wheat remained confined to a single 125-acre field on a single farm in eastern Oregon. Officials said there was no evidence the contaminated wheat was in the marketplace.Monsanto, which manufactured the altered gene and conducted field trials of the GM wheat several years ago, strongly suggested in a conference call with reporters on Friday that the company was the victim of sabotage of anti-GM campaigners. Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer, said: It's fair to say there are folks who don't like biotechnology and who would use this as an opportunity to make problems.The real story is unlikely to emerge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if at all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 until the publication of the final report by 18 Department of Agriculture investigators who are now scouring grain elevators, farmers' fields and university research stations in eastern Oregon, hunting for a few grains of suspicious wheat.The stakes are high for America's wheat exports, with Japan and South Korea cancelling shipments; for Monsanto, which faces lawsuits from farmers for falling wheat prices and a consumer backlash against GM products; and for the US government, which must shore up confidence in the safety and integrity of the food supply.The crisis for wheat farmers began in late April, with a phone call from a crop consultant seeking the advice of researchers at Oregon State University in Corvallis. The consultant had sprayed Roundup, a weed killer also manufactured by Monsanto, on some fallow land. Ordinarily, glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, would be expected to clean out the entire 125-acre field. This time, however, some plants survived.The consultant, fearing he had come across a \"superweed\", got in touch with the university and sent some plants in for testing. A clump of plants, carefully wrapped in plastic to keep them green, arrived by Fed-Ex on 30 April. Scientists separated 24 samples and tested them for the presence of Monsanto's Roundup Ready gene, CP4, which was developed to be resistant to glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup weed killer.\"They all came up positive,\" she said. So did a second battery of tests by another lab at the university and independent testing on a different set of wheat plants collected by researchers from the Department of Agriculture. The scientists were still slightly disbelieving, however. The only chance for contamination by the GM wheat, it was thought, was from field trials Monsanto conducted in the late 1990s until 2005.The wheat was grown in more than 100 test plots in 16 states over several years, but the company wound down the last of the trials in 2005, because it saw little market potential. Unlike the other big crops \u00e2\u0080\u0093 corn, soybeans, cotton and canola \u00e2\u0080\u0093 American farmers have never raised GM wheat on a commercial basis. The US exports much of its wheat to Asia and Europe, who do not want GM products. The Oregon field trials stopped in 2001.\"Our customers have zero-tolerance for GM wheat,\" said Wally Powell, president of the Oregon Wheat Growers League.Monsanto is currently testing a next generation of GM wheat in North Dakota and Hawaii. The company insists the seeds from those earlier trials were shipped backed to its labs in Missouri or destroyed in the field and driven deep into the earth with a backhoe.\"Most of the seed was destroyed in the field,\" said Jeff Koscelny, who heads Monsanto's wheat sales team. \"It never left the site, and it was buried. To us, it's not logical there were any seeds out there.\"    \n                \n\t\t\t\tMonsanto has faced a backlash over GM products. Photograph: Nigel Treblin/AFP/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nWhile Monsanto's chief technology officer suggested eco-activists were to blame, Mallory-Smith said deliberate contamination was the least likely scenario:The sabotage conspiracy theory is even harder for me to explain or think as logical because it would mean that someone had that seed and was holding that seed for 10 or 12 years and happened to put it on the right field to have it found, and identified. I don't think that makes a lot of sense.She was also sceptical of Monsanto's claims to have gathered up or destroyed every last seed from its earlier GM wheat trials. In recent years, as American farmers rely increasingly on GM crops, there have been a spate of such escapes, including rice, corn, soybean, and tomato. Oregon is still trying to contain a 2006 escape of GM bentgrass, used on golf courses, which has migrated 13 miles from where it was originally planted.\"Once we put a trait or a gene into the environment we can not expect that we are going to be able to retract or bring back that gene and find every last gene that we put out there,\" said Mallory-Smith. Tracing the course of an escape so long after Monsanto's field trials will be even more difficult, she said. \"It's like finding a needle in a hay stack,\" she said.One morning in late June, farmers from wheat-growing areas in Oregon, Idaho and Washington state drove their pick-up trucks to the station, to learn about the latest advances in farm technology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including toy-sized drones \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and to catch up on the latest on the GM wheat escape. Some of the farmers were relatively relaxed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those whose land sits relatively high up and don't expect to harvest their crop until August.Wheat prices reached historic highs before the GM discovery. If there is no further evidence of contamination, they figure they can ride out the crisis, store their wheat, and wait until Japan and South Korea place orders again. But there is also an undercurrent of suspicion and anger at the unidentified farmer who reported finding GM wheat on his land \u00e2\u0080\u0093 consequently putting all of their crops in jeopardy.\"It's a mystery to me how they even found that GM wheat,\" said Herb Marsh, 80, who has been farming in eastern Oregon his entire life. \"It's hard for me to swallow that he would go, and actually get it tested.\"It's just a big mystery,\" he said.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Company cries foul over appearance of genetically modified wheat plants but scientist who

in Ohio on Saturday.Graphic footage from local television channel WDTN showed a biplane flying upside-down close to the ground with a person strapped to the lower wing. The aircraft suddenly twisted and nose-dived, crashing into a grassy area. It bounced, broke apart and was immediately engulfed by a fireball.The incident took place at around 1pm local time, at the Vectren Dayton Air Show at Dayton International Airport. The wing-walker's name was reported by local media as Jane Wicker. According to the air show's official site, her act involved \"climbing, walking, and hanging all over her beautiful 450 HP Stearman aircraft \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 with no safety line and no parachute\".A statement on the show's website said: \"The accident was isolated and no other injuries were reported. FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] and other officials are on site investigating the incident. Air show officials have announced that the Saturday show flying operations have been cancelled and normal operations will resume on Sunday.\"Six years ago a stunt pilot, Jim LeRoy, was killed at the Dayton Air Show when his plane crashed and caught fire. Last year's show attracted 47,000 spectators, according to the Dayton Daily News.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Organisers of Vectren Dayton Air Show cancel Saturday flying and say

By using the sites you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described.About our advertisingIn late 2005 we launched a new advertising service called Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA). OBA allows us to deliver targeted advertising to visitors to our website. OBA works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and your interaction with the site, and delivering adverts which we believe may be of interest to you.As you browse our sites some of the cookies we place on your computer will be advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in. This information we collect about behaviour on your computer enables us to group it with computers that show similar behaviour. We can then display advertising to your computer which is based on these interests. For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles we may decide to show you more adverts for food and drink. It is important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we employ uses or requires us to collect information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number. We may also share anonymised behavioural data with advertising partners. This may mean that when you are on other websites you are served advertising based on your behaviour on guardian.co.uk and guardiannews.com, and on guardian.co.uk and guardiannnews.com you may be served advertising based on your behaviour on other sites.Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA that enables us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on browsing patterns and interactions with the site away from our sites. For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing. This is allows companies to advertise to website visitors who leave their website without making a purchase. The privacy policy of criteo, one of the partners that we work with for behavioural retargeting is here: criteo.com/en/privacy-policy.If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our sites. It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised for you.If you would like more information about OBA and how to opt out of it, please visit youronlinechoices.com or  networkadvertising.org (if accessing from the US.)Please visit audiencescience.com/privacy.asp, quantcast.com/privacy and flurry.com/privacy-policy.html for the privacy policy of our online behavioural targeting technology providers.Advertising on mobile devices may require the collection and sharing of the unique device ID with companies who purchase advertising space on the mobile application.Other AdvertisingOur sites contain contextual affiliate links from which we may earn revenue.

address to the nation that her government is listening to the demands of hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets, while also warning that she would \"maintain order\".After more than a week of massive protests across Brazil and often violent clashes involving the police, Rousseff finally broke a near-silence as she used a prime time television broadcast to state that peaceful demonstrations were part of a strong democracy.Standing before a Brazilian flag, she said that the government knew there were many things \"we can do quicker and better\" and that Brazil \"fought hard to become a democratic country\" but that she could not tolerate the violence carried out by a minority of the protesters.Rousseff pointedly referred to sacrifices her generation made to free the nation from dictatorship \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0she is a former Marxist rebel who fought against Brazil's 1964-85 military regime and was imprisoned for three years and tortured by the junta. \"We need to oxygenate our political system \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and make it more transparent,\" Rousseff said in response to the protests, which have sprung from a range of grievances including poor public services, corruption and the billions of dollars spent preparing for next year's World Cup tournament and the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.Unveiling details of a series of reforms that she and her government hope will defuse the unrest of recent days, the Brazilian president announced she would draft new plans for public transport and that all oil royalties would be channelled towards education.Thousands of doctors would be brought in from overseas to assist the Brazilian public health service, she said.Turning to fears that the unrest has cast a shadow over Brazil's hosting of the World Cup, she described football as a symbol of peace and told viewers that it was important for Brazilians to extend a welcome to citizens of other countries who have hosted Brazilian teams and fans through the decades.Rousseff and key ministers met on Friday following a night of protests\u00c2\u00a0with simultaneous demonstrations\u00c2\u00a0in at least 80 cities across Brazil. It is thought the\u00c2\u00a0total turnout may have been close to two million.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Dilma Rousseff promises new plan for public transport and oil cash for

defenders of food stamps on Thursday to deal a shocking defeat to the proposed $500bn, five-year farm bill backed by Republican leaders, undermining hopes of enacting such legislation before the current stop-gap law expires.\"Today's failure leaves the entire food and agriculture sector in the lurch,\" the American Soybean Association, a group which represents growers, said in a statement.Frank Lucas, chairman of the House agriculture committee, said there may not be another chance to craft a farm bill this year.The level of funding for food stamps for low-income Americans was the major issue for the farm bill. Lucas's bill called for the largest cuts in food stamps in a generation. The Senate passed a bill last week that proposed a $4bn cut, compared to the $20bn cut of the House bill.The cuts in the House legislation would have ended benefits to 2 million people, or about 4% of enrolment. Majority leader Eric Cantor blamed Democrats for the outcome, saying they were not interested in consensus.Steny Hoyer, the assistant Democratic leader, said the bill failed because Republicans insisted on \"egregious\" changes to food stamps.All but two dozen Democrats in the House voted against the bill. The biggest surprise was that about one quarter of the Republican majority also voted no, in most instances because they wanted the bill to include deeper cuts to food stamps and other programs than proposed. The 234-195 vote undermined hopes of enacting a farm bill before the current stop-gap law expires in the fall. Moments before defeat, Lucas appealed to his colleagues, \"Vote with me to move this forward ... if it fails today, I cannot guarantee you'll see in this session another attempt.\" \"I am glad we stood up for children,\" said Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, after the vote. The bill died in the House in 2012 in an election-year gridlock that also revolved mostly around food stamp cuts. The just-passed Senate farm bill proposed $24bn in savings, half of it from traditional crop subsidies. Both bills proposed to cut conservation programs by $6bn while streamlining them. And both would expand the taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance program, including policies for cotton and peanut growers to protect them from fluctuations in crop revenue.\n    ", "og:type": "article",

"Whistleblower charged with espionage reportedly claims US authorities accessed millions of private text messages in China", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/22/edward-snowden-us-china", "text": "\n\t    Edward Snowden, the former CIA technician who blew the whistle on global surveillance operations, has opened a new front against the US authorities, claiming they hacked into Chinese mobile phone companies to access millions of private text messages.His latest claims came as US officials, who have filed criminal charges against him, warned Hong Kong to comply with an extradition request or risk complicating diplomatic relations after some of the territory's politicians called for Snowden to be protected.The latest developments will raise fears that the US's action may have pushed Snowden into the hands of the Chinese, triggering what could be a tense and prolonged diplomatic and legal wrangle between the world's two leading superpowers.Snowden, whose whereabouts have not been publicly known since he checked out of a Hong Kong hotel on 10\u00a0June, was reported by the Chinese media on Saturday to be in a \"safe place\" in the former British colony.The 30-year-old intelligence analyst has over the past three weeks leaked a series of documents to the Guardian revealing how US and UK secret services gain access to huge amounts of phone and internet data, raising serious questions about privacy in the internet age.On Friday, based on documents from Snowden, the Guardian reported that Britain's spy agency GCHQ has secretly gained access to the network of cables carrying the world's phone calls and internet traffic, without the authorities having made this known to the public. It was also reported that GCHQ is processing vast streams of sensitive information which it is sharing with its US partner, the National Security Agency.On Saturday the former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who now chairs the intelligence and security committee, said the committee would launch an investigation into the latest revelations. The committee will receive an official report from GCHQ about the story within days and will then decide whether to call witnesses to give oral evidence. If it is then thought necessary, the committee can require GCHQ to submit relevant data.Within hours of news breaking that the US had filed charges against Snowden, the South China Morning Post reported that the whistleblower had handed over a series of documents to the paper detailing how the US had targeted Chinese phone companies as part of a widespread attempt to get its hands on a mass of data.Text messaging is the most popular form of communication in mainland China where more than 900bn SMS messages were exchanged in 2012.Snowden reportedly told the paper: \"The NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data.\"The paper said Snowden had also passed on information detailing NSA attacks on China's prestigious Tsinghua University, the hub of a major digital network from which data on millions of Chinese citizens could be harvested.As Snowden made his latest disclosures, the US issued an extradition request to Hong Kong and piled pressure on the territory to respond swiftly. \"If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law,\" a senior Obama administration official said.Snowden appeared to be gaining support from politicians in Hong Kong who said China should support him against any extradition application from the US, which on Friday charged him under its Espionage Act. One legislator, Leung Kwok-hung, said Beijing should issue instructions to protect Snowden from extradition before his case was dragged through the courts. Leung urged the Hong Kong people to \"take to the streets to protect Snowden\". Another politician, Cyd Ho, vice-chairwoman of the pro-democracy Labour party, said China \"should now make its stance clear to the Hong Kong SAR [Special Administrative Region] government\" before the case goes before a court.China has urged Washington to provide explanations following Snowden's disclosures that NSA programs collect millions of telephone records and track foreign internet activity on US networks. In a press conference Hong Kong's police commissioner, Andy Tsang, indicated that the normal legal process would be followed after the US filed criminal charges. \"All foreign citizens must comply with Hong Kong's law,\" he said, adding that the police would act on the request once it was received.He declined to comment on reports in one Hong Kong newspaper that Snowden is already in a police safe house.In response to the Guardian's latest revelations regarding the surveillance activities of GCHQ, politicians and freedom of information campaigners raised concerns about the lack of oversight and up-to-date laws with which to monitor and regulate the activities of the secret services. Former Foreign Office minister David Davis MP said documents containing an admission by GCHQ lawyers that UK oversight was \"light\" compared with that in the US were particularly worrying.\"This reinforces the view that the oversight structure is wholly inadequate. Really what is needed is a full-scale independent judicial oversight that reports to parliament.\"Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, said: \"It's possible to be shocked but not surprised at this blanket surveillance on a breathtaking scale. The authorities appear to be kidding themselves with a very generous interpretation of the law that cannot stand with article 8 of the European convention on human rights.\"To argue this isn't snooping because they haven't got time to read all this private information is like arguing we'd all be comfortable with our homes being raided and our private papers copied \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as long as the authorities stored them in sealed plastic bags.\"Carl Miller, director for social media at the thinktank Demos, said: \"Just like the rest of us, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using social media and other forms of online communication. So it's clear that the intelligence services should be able to access this where it is necessary and proportionate. But this is the crucial point. What these latest stories reveal is that much of this surveillance is happening already, but without the security services having made the public argument for these powers. There is a clear need for a legal grounding or oversight structure that commands public confidence.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Whistleblower charged with espionage reportedly

libellous leaflet that was highly critical of McDonald's, and which led to the longest civil trial in English history, costing the fast-food chain millions of pounds in fees.The true identity of one of the authors of the \"McLibel leaflet\" is Bob Lambert, a police officer who used the alias Bob Robinson in his five years infiltrating the London Greenpeace group, is revealed in a new book about undercover policing of protest, published next week.McDonald's famously sued green campaigners over the roughly typed leaflet, in a landmark three-year high court case, that was widely believed to have been a public relations disaster for the corporation. Ultimately the company won a libel battle in which it spent millions on lawyers.Lambert was deployed by the special demonstration squad (SDS) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a top-secret Metropolitan police unit that targeted political activists between 1968 until 2008, when it was disbanded. He co-wrote the defamatory six-page leaflet in 1986 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and his role in its production has been the subject of an internal Scotland Yard investigation for several months.At no stage during the civil legal proceedings brought by McDonald's in the 1990s was it disclosed that a police infiltrator helped author the leaflet.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tThe McLibel two: Helen Steel and David Morris, outside a branch of McDonald's in London in 2005 after winning their case in the European court of human rights. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian\n\t\t\t\n            \nA spokesman for the Met said the force \"recognises the seriousness of the allegations of inappropriate behaviour and practices involving past undercover deployments\". He added that a number of allegations surrounding the undercover officers were currently being investigated by a team overseen by the chief constable of Derbyshire police, Mick Creedon.And in remarks that come closest to acknowledging the scale of the scandal surrounding police spies, the spokesman said: \"At some point it will fall upon this generation of police leaders to account for the activities of our predecessors, but for the moment we must focus on getting to the truth.\"Lambert declined to comment about his role in the production of the McLibel leaflet. However, he previously offered a general apology for deceiving \"law abiding members of London Greenpeace\", which he said was a peaceful campaign group.Lambert, who rose through the ranks to become a spymaster in the SDS, is also under investigation for sexual relationships he had with four women while undercover, one of whom he fathered a child with before vanishing from their lives. The woman and her son only discovered that Lambert was a police spy last year.The internal police inquiry is also investigating claims raised in parliament that Lambert ignited an incendiary device at a branch of Debenhams when infiltrating animal rights campaigners. The incident occurred in 1987 and the explosion inflicted \u00c2\u00a3300,000 worth of damage to the branch in Harrow, north London. Lambert has previously strongly denied he planted the incendiary device in the Debenhams store.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tWhile McDonald's won the initial legal battle, at great expense, it was seen as a PR disaster. Photograph: Image Broker/Rex Features\n\t\t\t\n            \nLambert's role in helping compose the McLibel leaflet is revealed in 'Undercover: The True Story of Britain's Secret Police', which is published next week. An extract from the book will be published in the Guardian Weekend magazine. A joint Guardian/Channel 4 investigation into undercover policing will be broadcast on Dispatches on Monday evening.Lambert was one of two SDS officers who infiltrated London Greenpeace; the second, John Dines, had a two-year relationship with Helen Steel, who later became the co-defendant in the McLibel case. The book reveals how Steel became the focus of police surveillance operations. She had a sexual relationship with Dines, before he also disappeared without a trace.Dines gained access to the confidential legal advice given to Steel and her co-defendant that was written by Keir Starmer, then a barrister known for championing radical causes. The lawyer was advising the activists on how to defend themselves against McDonald's. He is now the director of public prosecutions in England and Wales.Lambert was lauded by colleagues in the covert unit for his skilful infiltration of animal rights campaigners and environmentalists in the 1980s. He succeeded in transforming himself from a special branch detective into a long-haired radical activist who worked as a cash-in-hand gardener. He became a prominent member of London Greenpeace, around the time it began campaigning against McDonald's in 1985. The leaflet he helped write made wide-ranging criticisms of the company, accusing it of destroying the environment, exploiting workers and selling junk food.Four sources who were either close to Lambert at the time, or involved in the production of the leaflet, have confirmed his role in composing the libellous text. Lambert confided in one of his girlfriends from the era, although he appeared keen to keep his participation hidden. \"He did not want people to know he had co-written it,\" Belinda Harvey said.Paul Gravett, a London Greenpeace campaigner, said the spy was one of a small group of around five activists who drew up the leaflet over several months. Another close friend from the time recalls Lambert was really proud of the leaflet. \"It was like his baby, he carried it around with him,\" the friend said.When Lambert's undercover deployment ended in 1989, he vanished, claiming that he had to flee abroad because he was being pursued by special branch. None of his friends or girlfriends suspected that special branch was his employer.It was only later that the leaflet Lambert helped to produce became the centre of the huge trial. Even though the activists could only afford to distribute a few hundred copies of the leaflet, McDonald's decided to throw all of its legal might at the case, suing two London Greenpeace activists for libel.Two campaigners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Steel, who was then a part-time bartender, and an unemployed postal worker, Dave Morris \u00e2\u0080\u0093 unexpectedly stood their ground and refused to apologise.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tSteel and Morris outside the high court at the start of the first proceedings in the McLibel trial in 1990. Photograph: Photofusion/UIG/ Getty Images\n\t\t\t\n            \nOver 313 days in the high court, the pair defended themselves, with pro bono assistance from Starmer, as they could not afford to hire any solicitors or barristers. In contrast, McDonald's hired some of the best legal minds at an estimated cost of \u00c2\u00a310m. During the trial, legal argument largely ignored the question of who wrote the McLibel leaflet, focusing instead on its distribution to members of the public.In 1997, a high court judge ruled that much of the leaflet was libellous and ordered the two activists to pay McDonald's \u00c2\u00a360,000 in damages. This sum was reduced on appeal to \u00c2\u00a340,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but McDonald's never enforced payment.It was a hollow victory for the company; the long-running trial had exposed damaging stories about its business and the quality of the food it was selling to millions of customers around the world. The legal action, taking advantage of Britain's much-criticised libel laws, was seen as a heavy handed and intimidating way of crushing criticism. However, the role of undercover police in the story remained, until now, largely unknown.On Friday, Morris said the campaign against the burger chain was successful \"despite the odds overwhelmingly stacked against us in the legal system and up against McDonald's massive and relentless advertising and propaganda machine.\"We now know that other shadowy forces were also trying to undermine our efforts in the most disgusting, but ultimately futile ways. All over the world police and secret agents infiltrate opposition movements in order to protect the rich and powerful but as we have seen in so many countries recently people power and the pursuit of truth and justice is unstoppable, even faced with the most repressive and unacceptable Stasi-like tactics.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Exclusive: McDonald's sued green activists

But most Palestinians would have none of this and Saturday's revelry was like the end-of-Ramadan holiday combined with the World Cup final.The scale of the celebrations easily outstripped most political or protest rallies of recent years and far exceeded those held after Palestinians gained non-member statehood in a vote at the UN general assembly in November 2012.Many political leaders, who have increasingly alienated Palestinians with their bickering, have sought to try to hitch a ride from Assaf's galloping popularity. Some greying officials changed their Facebook profile pictures to his smiling face and spiked hair, urged people to text him their votes and praised his nationalist credentials. \"This win is a source of pride and a victory for our people on the road to achieving its dream of establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,\" President Mahmoud Abbas said. Abbas was jolted this week by his prime minister's surprise offer to resign and faces pressure from the US secretary of state, John Kerry, to jumpstart stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.But for locals, Assaf was all and politics took a backseat. \"In the middle of the political failures Assaf achieved something that made Palestinians everywhere feel hope was still possible,\" said Imad Ahmed, a teacher from Gaza watching the show with his family at a beachfront restaurant.After the victory Assaf was named by the UN as its first youth ambassador to Palestinian refugee camps in the territories and neighbouring countries. He is expected to visit the West Bank to perform.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Jubilation among Palestinians as singer who grew up in refugee camp wins over voters across Arab

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/22/fashion-industry-no-ethics", "text": "\n\t    Since getting itself talked about was the only comprehensible reason why a lifestyle magazine would run a suicide-themed fashion spread, last week's internationally condemned fashion spread on suicide was a triumph for a publication that one might, in a supremely futile act of resistance, not bother to name. The whole thing could hardly have gone better: from publication of \"Last Words\", to the first tweeted expressions of outrage, to lengthy condemnatory articles, to withdrawal of the offending piece, and the editors' widely publicised semi-grovel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all within 24 hours.Throughout, the publication responsible was introduced in news stories as \"the hipster's bible\", a trusted, super-edgy brand, new readers learned, for the kind of dashing young iconoclasts who dress in Prada or Issa \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a couple of the labels into which the fashion team had inserted models pretending to be famous women writers just after, or in a more how-to mode, in the act of, suicide. One of the late writers has a living, 11-year-old son. In its apology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which will have doubled as a perfect, hi, subscribe and we'll send you 12 issues per year opportunity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the editors explained that their fashion spreads \"are always unconventional\".The women suicides shoot, for instance, was a hipsterish way of focusing \"on the demise of a set of writers whose lives we very much wish weren't cut tragically short, especially at their own hands\". Just as you might, say, use a fashion spread to focus on the demise of a set of underpaid garment workers whose lives you wished weren't cut tragically short, especially in a collapsed building.Once it's explained, you get that posing demised bodies in the latest must-haves is an unconventional fash way of showing you care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so long, obviously, that no clothes are harmed in the process. And that shockwaves are bound to be created, among non-hipsters, when fashion is approached this way, as the magazine puts it, \"with an art editorial point of view rather than a typical fashion photo-editorial one\".Now the only people who could be offended by that excuse, surely, are the many rival fashion magazines who work, no less tirelessly, and with an equal disregard for convention, to ensure that their own work resembles art and not \"typical fashion photo-editorial\". Think, for example, of the current Interview magazine sequence, in which pathological hoarding, rather than suicide, is having a moment. In \"The Hoarder\", this magazine's study in mental disorder/fash contrasts, a pallid beauty poses amid piled-up filth and chaos. \"She's a contemporary Miss Havisham, as modernity meets tradition and classically tailored coats and jackets meet exaggerated boots and enormous wedges,\" runs the caption, referencing fashion's favourite \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if non-hoarding \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Dickens character: \"Here comes pre-Fall.\"Cond\u00c3\u00a9 Nast staff, too, must be justifiably affronted by the suggestion that the suicide-fashion team have the monopoly on in-your-face fashion provocation. Was not Vogue Italia, a few years back, the first to show models looking dead in a polluted, seaside context, \"precious reportage that delivers an artistic impact\"? The photographer Steven Meisel laid the model Kristen McMenamy out like, sort of, BP's dead seabirds, if they, too, had expired in tastefully wrecked Ralph Lauren and Clinique. \"She keeps her skin golden thanks to Self Tan Face Bronzing Gel Tint (to wear alone or with foundation),\" is how Vogue glossed the desperate scene, with the pragmatic attention to detail that distinguishes this field of artistic endeavour: \"It takes care of the skin, while giving it a hint of colour.\"If last week's suicide creatives did not, incomprehensible as this might seem, ever consider issues of taste or responsibility, as this exercise in suicide trivialisation progressed from being deliciously out there into a glossy finished product, it could be because the absence of principles is, in so many respects, still vital to fashion industry profits. Start obsessing about taste and responsibility and where will it all stop? If fashion editors conceded, for instance, the case against dressing up death and illness to sell tights and enormous wedges and, thereby, advertising space, they might, in no time, be confronting equally difficult questions about their glamorising of emaciation, and of allegedly tax-evading designers and of tyranny, in those ever popular, meet-the-psychopath's-wife slots.As much as the invention of ethical fashion has raised awareness of the pollution and human exploitation intrinsic to an industry built on waste, it may also have contributed, less usefully, to an expectation that, if only fashion could guarantee carbon neutrality and fair trade, it would emerge as, if not 100% wholesome, no worse than any other form of cultural production. If greenness and improved sweatshops are all it needs to be ethical, we can look forward to John Galliano's ethical antisemitism, Ralph Lauren's ethical bribery and Dolce and Gabbana's ethical tax-evasion. Or how about a new line in ethical interviews in which we find, say, Asma al-Assad, Vogue's \"Anon GM Rose in the Desert\", in scrupulously vintage Loubs, with a special message about sustainable oppression?Going further in the application of ethics to fashion, it may not be fanciful to imagine a time when the regular distribution of clothes, accessories and beauty products, gifts whereby legions of fashion writers, celebrities and bloggers are groomed by fashion PRs into a condition of helpless adulation, is restricted to strictly recyclable items.It's more difficult, though, to see how eco-friendly ethics would influence some equally long-established fashion traditions, such as paying Hollywood names to sit, fan-like, in the front row or, equally, persecuting journalists who have misused that privilege.Thanks to a few journalists, including Liz Jones, Laura Craik and the Guardian's Hadley Freeman, who was once banned from his show by national treasure Paul Smith, the public is gaining some appreciation of the human cost of keeping fashion coverage permanently ecstatic, about absolutely everything.When, for example, Cathy Horyn, fashion editor of the New York Times, advertised her eight-year exclusion from his shows, an exercised Hedi Slimane, the Saint Laurent designer, confirmed that, for all that it's now the stuff of doting V&A and Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibitions, fashion remains altogether too fabulous an art to be subjected to normal rules of critical engagement.Horyn was, Slimane said , a \"schoolyard bully\", \"thick\" and, style-wise, \"seriously challenged\". Publishers and theatre directors must dream, reading stuff like this, of enjoying the same power to insult and exclude unhelpful journalists, without surrendering a fraction of the esteem they enjoy among more amenable critics or, at any rate, among the ones who depend on their advertising or handbags.For, like designer tax evasion, garment sweatshops and the fate of tissue-eating models, the

She looks like a contemplative Madonna on screen, with long, fair hair. She listens more than she talks. She encourages her family to speak. Her film may be her story \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but she gets others to tell it. Michael Polley, her British-born father \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an actor who worked for an insurance company  \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at one dramatic point says he will not try to \"guess\" what Sarah's thoughts are. But I can do nothing else. And now, on an overcast, humid morning, I am hurrying to meet her in downtown Toronto, through streets that seem a cross between Dalston and Cape Cod. Every other ramshackle shop seems to be attempting to evolve into an art gallery. One shop promises to waylay passers by and teach them how to knit. I pass more than one itinerant woman in shabby chic clothes. The lady is not a tramp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the tramp is a lady. I have never seen a city with  glossier, better tended roses.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n                \n\nStories We Tell\n            Production year: 2012\n                Country: Rest of the world\n                    Runtime: 108 mins\n                Directors: Sarah Polley\n                    More on this film\n    \n\n    \n    \nAnd now here it is: Cafe Diplomatico, Little Italy, nicknamed \"the Dip\", which has been open for business for 45 years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a Toronto landmark. I sit in the shade and wait. A tiny figure, with a tentative tread, appears on the pavement opposite. I decide it cannot be Sarah. But it is. Dainty as a dancer, she is wearing a blue denim jacket, a scarlet shirt and sneakers to match. She has a transparent complexion and guileless smile. Everything about her, including her handshake, has a lightness of touch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like her work. What is different is that she is hospitably voluble. We break the ice \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not that there is much to break \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with talk of Toronto. She fills me in on an \"epic disaster of the mayor who has been accused of smoking crack\" (he denies it) but otherwise describes the city as \"diverse, tolerant, multicultural\". She adds: \"I love living here \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I have always lived here, it is an easy city.\"She orders brunch (\"two eggs over easy with bacon and HP sauce\"). She already has a classy track record as a film director. In 2006, she directed Away From Her, about a woman suffering from Alzheimer's (Julie Christie was nominated for an Oscar). In 2011, her second film, Take This Waltz \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a love story starring Michelle Williams \u00e2\u0080\u0093 split opinion (I loved it; Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian could barely contain his contempt). All Polley's films, in different ways, explore marriage and its complexities with compassionate grace. And Stories We Tell, five years in the making, is no exception. It is a cine-memoir of Sarah's parents, an extended family's portrait of itself. And it includes a stunning secret (it would spoil the film's delicate detective work to spill it). Besides, what gives the film its distinction are the questions it raises that reach beyond plot: do we own our own stories or do they own us? Is there such a thing as emotional copyright? And why is memory a teasing resource?Michael Polley is the film's chief narrator. For years, he was an author in search of a subject. Now Sarah has given him one. His quirky, engagingly self-deprecatory commentary contributes hugely to the film's charm. Like a father surveying his family from the head of a dining table, he reads aloud, savouring the narrative. Even when it is at its most uncomfortable, he seems in his element. I tell Sarah I have been speculating about Michael's writing and her film-making and wondering: were they each driven by the same need to control out-of-control experience? \"I was more concerned the film should include everybody's version and not be one-dimensional,\" Sarah says, but concedes: \"Telling stories is our way of coping, a way of creating shape out of a mess. It binds everyone together.\" Yet her film also reveals that everyone has a subtly different story to tell. Memory is not a convenient barn in which truth can be stored through successive winters. It is permeable, unreliable and personal. And it is complicated because, in a family, as Polley points out, everyone is \"committed\" to their own version of the truth.This family consists of Sarah's sister Susy (51), a thoughtful GP, and her brother John (50), a winningly camp casting director \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the children of Sarah's mother's first marriage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mark (45), a delightful lawyer, and Joanna (41), an attractive teacher with a PhD in philosophy. Michael's the father of the last two, along with Sarah who, at 34, is the youngest of this open, intelligent, likable bunch. It was \"easy\" to interview her family, she says, because, \"There are no taboos at our dinner table. There was nothing I felt uncomfortable asking. It is not often you get that freedom interviewing.\"  I can imagine because I feel a similarly relaxed freedom talking to Sarah.What binds the \"children\" is their mother, Diane Polley \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an actress and casting director \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who died when Sarah was 11. The film is a loving but complicated homage. It includes many friends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of whom have versions of her. Geoff Bowes, a fellow actor, remembers the infectious gaiety of acting with her in Montreal. Another friend, Mort Ransen, speaks of her fear of cancer and likens her to a trembling bird. Film producer Harry Gulkin describes her magnetism and takes Sarah to task because he wants the story told his way. What is moving is how keenly everyone feels the loss of Diane, more than 20 years on.The film mixes Super 8 home-movie footage and convincing reconstructions also shot in  Super 8 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Diane is played by Rebecca Jenkins (who knew her in life). She emerges as a woman who had the gallantry to treat life like a party even when it did not return the compliment. Is Sarah at all like her? \"Some people say I am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but I'm more restrained.\"  She sees herself as a part-time extrovert. \"I oscillate between being watchful and out of control.\" Sarah is surprised but not displeased the faux footage has fooled audiences: \"I had been wondering, in my own life, what was real and what wasn't. I wanted people to have the same question in their minds.\"Making the film has changed the way Sarah sees her mother. She used to think her \"vibrant but distracted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not engaged enough with me\". Now, she feels \"a lot more admiration. She was competent and beautiful [unusual to dovetail these adjectives]. She had five kids, commuted to work and yet she slept so little. She took care of us brilliantly. We would always have a good dinner on the table \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually with home-baked dessert. She did so much \u00e2\u0080\u0093 perhaps it is not such a surprise she died at 53.\"Characterising a parent is an odd business because it involves detaching from the early, unquestioning relationship and, on one level, becoming your parent's parent in the process. \"When I watch the black-and-white footage of my mother auditioning, staring out into the audience, I feel maternal about her,\" Sarah says. This is a fantastic moment in the film (no reconstruction involved). Diane sings a spoof of Ain't Misbehavin' called I'm Misbehaving. But actually, she is on her best behaviour. She is nervous (biting her lower lip) and vulnerable (apologising for fluffing the song's last line). Sarah sees her as \"exposed\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 here and elsewhere. She wonders how her mother would have felt about the film. And she minds terribly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is  fearful  \"conservative\" people will judge her mother censoriously. She finds it \"nerve-racking\" to think anyone might find her wanting.Diane Polley was used to harsh judgment. After her first marriage failed, she was the first woman in Canada to lose custody of her children, permitted to see John and Susy only once a month. One of the film's most moving sequences records the feelings about this cruelty all these years later. Sarah even found \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and filmed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a newspaper cutting reporting on the case. \"As a middle-class woman with a career, it is unimaginable to think of a woman having her children taken away because her 'desire for a career overtook her domestic duties'.\" Sarah was \"staggered\" to find an article that coldly spelt out that, for Diane, this was \"the cost of adultery\". During her childhood, the case had understandably been \"underplayed\". Sarah now smarts on her mother's behalf to think of the \"shame\" she must have felt. She adds that she was never under any illusions about her mother's \"devastation and guilt at losing Johnny and Susy\".And then Sarah tells me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at my prompting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about her last memory of her mother: \"A few days before she died and just before she went into a coma, I remember Dad dancing with her to Blue Spanish Eyes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of her favourite songs. He was holding her on his feet as she couldn't stand and she started crying. And I remember him saying to make her laugh: 'I never could stand dancing with a woman who cried.'\" The love Michael felt for her is still visible in the film \u00e2\u0080\u0093 although he makes no bones about the difficulties of their marriage, freely describing it as \"stale\" and blaming himself. He is hilarious in the process, claiming: \"A night with a dead wombat might be more exciting than a night with me after 12 years.\"When Diane died, on 10 January, 1990, Sarah and Michael were left to their own devices. It was \"a very, very dark period. My dad is very open about this in the film. We all, in various ways, fell apart. It felt like the house was coming apart at the seams \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the disarray of loss.\" A snap of Sarah and Michael shows them smiling alongside a tall snowman they had created: an image of playful togetherness. He tried hard and, to some extent, rallied. He taught himself to cook \"amazingly\". And, looking back, Sarah acknowledges that \"taking care of me became the centre of his life\". But, she explains: \"Being a parent was not how Michael would describe himself. This was not a traditional father-child relationship. He never strove for that. He looked up to his kids. He treated kids as equals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for better or for worse. He'd speak to you with respect. And you had a responsibility that most children would not have. We became very close.\" She remembers staying up until the small hours talking about books with Michael \"and smoking\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she laughs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and \"not wanting to be anywhere else\".    \n                \n\t\t\t\tSarah Polley: Stories We Tell Photograph: Roadside Attractions/Rex Features\n\t\t\t\n            \nBut there was one puzzle that did not go away. Sarah grew up with a family joke that she did not look anything like her siblings. Where did the reddish hair come from? Her mother used to laugh about it. There were other things she did not share with her siblings either. \"I am highly strung, neurotic about responsibility and punctuality. I am compulsively early \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I get to airports three hours early.\" In the film she determines to find out whether the joke has substance, a quest that will eventually lead to a \"sick feeling of responsibility and an enormous crushing guilt that laid me out for a few weeks. I got really, really ill. It took a friend to clarify for me that finding a story\u00a0is not the same as creating one.\" George Bernard Shaw wrote: \"If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well make it dance.\" In the film, that is what Sarah\u00a0does.Her first career was an actor. And she has not given up on it now \u00e2\u0080\u0093 although with the directing and writing (she is working on a screenplay of Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace) there has been no spare time. She made her acting debut aged four and is critical of the way child actors are treated. At nine, her role in the Canadian television series Road to Avonlea made her name and enough money with which, much later, to think about making a film. At 14, she left home. At 15, she moved in with a boyfriend and, at 16, she was living on her own with \"lots of rotting potatoes under the sink and a lack of life skills\". It was at this time that she famously got \"roughed up\" by riot police protesting at a conservative government cutting welfare benefits and lost two back teeth. At least that was her story. \"At 15, I exaggerated constantly,\" she laughs.In 2003 she got married, to David Wharnsby, a film editor. She describes him as \"a really great person\" but the marriage did not last and, in 2011, she married David Sandomierski, a lawyer with whom she has a 16-month-old daughter named Eve. There is a memorable line from Take This Waltz that goes: \"Life has a gap in it, it just does.\" And Polley believes: \"We blame relationships for that gap. We are never going to feel that life is complete but we live in an age that tells us that this is a problem.\" She thinks it too easy to \"blame the person with whom we are sharing our life\".So does she see marriage as a doomed enterprise? \"I think marriage is crazy and optimistic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that is what is great about it. I like bold gestures that aren't necessarily backed up by statistics. I feel really committed to it. But my family is enormously judgmental of the institution. When I said I was getting married for a second time, the interrogation  lasted many months. And during the ceremony, when the congregation was asked whether anyone objected, five hands went up. The officiator just said: never mind.\" And then she relates how Michael made a speech that \"sounded like it would go somewhere really nice, then didn't. He wound up saying that when he married, in 1967, his one hope was that his children would never feel they had to participate in something so absurd.\"Whatever the friendly difference of opinion about wedlock, the remarkable thing is that when pressed about her family's reaction to Stories We Tell, Sarah reveals that everyone is happy with the film and has been \"supportive\". What's more, there is a freedom now, a sense that \"the story does not belong to anyone\". And telling it has brought her closer to Michael. She sees the harnessing of his writing talent as \"something my mother always wanted, a last thing I could do for her\". But she wants to impress on me that she still regards her story as ordinary, whatever others may say. It is the remembering that matters. Michael quotes Pablo Neruda: \"Love is so short, forgetting so long.\" Since making the film, she volunteers, she keeps hearing stories far more \"extraordinary\" than her own. And then she turns to me: do I have a family secret? All families, she suggests, do. \"And the ones that don't think they do have not scratched the surface hard enough yet.\"Stories We Tell is released in cinemas on 28 July.

She became a professional tennis player at 13 and, in a career spanning\u00a017 years, won 22 Grand Slam singles titles. In 1988 she became the first woman to achieve the Golden Slam by winning all four\u00a0Grand Slam singles titles and Olympic gold. She is married to Andre Agassi, has two children and lives in Las Vegas. She runs the charity Children For Tomorrow.When were you happiest? My happiness lives in the present. It's my life this morning, this evening, with Andre, my kids.What is your greatest fear? That the world we are passing on to\u00a0our children is not the world we\u00a0hoped for for them.Which living person do you most admire, and why?The man I know the best: Andre.What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?I am a serial procrastinator.What is the trait you most deplore in others?Inconsideration.What was your most embarrassing moment?Any time I'm in front of a mic.Property aside, what's the most expensive thing you've bought? The first racket Andre used in a pro match at 16 and the one from his last game \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the bookends of his career.What is your most treasured possession?My memory.What would your super power be?To eradicate the effects of war. Then to eradicate war. Then to eradicate the reason for war.What is your favourite book?The Tender Bar, by JR Moehringer. After reading it, Andre collaborated with JR on his memoir, Open.What is your guiltiest pleasure?Anything sweet is my kryptonite.What do you most dislike about your appearance?Where do I start?What would be your fancy dress costume of choice? Catwoman. Cher. Bj\u00c3\u00b6rk. Halloween at our house is intense.What was the best kiss of your life?The kiss of a parent, the kiss of your husband, the kiss of your children: you receive them in that order in life, and they each make you feel alive in a different way.Who would you invite to your dream dinner party?The five living first ladies.Which words or phrases do you most overuse?\"Next question.\"If you could edit your past, what would you change?The good, the bad, all of it, got me to\u00a0the life I live today. Leave it in.When did you last cry, and why?He said it was guacamole. It was wasabi.How do you relax?I find more peace in the rumble of our busy lives than in a quiet house.What single thing would improve the quality of your life?A pause button. If I could be watching my kids enjoy something, and hit pause to make it last.What keeps you awake at night?Andre, the kids, my foundation and sometimes the dogs.How would you like to be remembered?As a happy, caring mother and wife.What is the most important lesson life has taught you?A new day means a new chance to be the person you want to be.Where would you most like to be right now?Around the kitchen table with Andre, the kids, their friends, our families. It's noisy, fun and carefree, and there's not another place I'd rather be.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 My Body, My Enemy, by Claire Beeken with Rosanna Greenstreet, is available as an ebook from amazon.co.uk.Follow Rosanna Greenstreet on Twitter.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "'When did I last cry, and why?

the energy giant, could be free before the end of the decade after he was given a shorter sentence as a result of an agreement with prosecutors. Jeff Skilling, who was originally sentenced to more than 24 years in 2006, was resentenced to 14 years at a court in Houston on Friday.A federal judge in signed off on an agreement betwee Skilling and federal prosecutors, under which he will drop his appeal and forfeit $40m in assets seized by the government. Skilling was given the longest sentence of any executive involved in the 2001 collapse of Enron, once one of the world's largest energy companies. The company's fall was one of the biggest business scandals of the decade, costing thousands their jobs and wiping out billions for shareholders and pensioners.In May 2006, Skilling was convicted on 19 charges including conspiracy, insider trading, securities fraud and making false statements to auditors. US district judge Sim Lake sentenced Skilling to 292 months \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than 24 years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in prison.The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay, was also found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy and fraud. He died of heart failure six weeks after the trial ended.An appeals court ruled in 2009 that Skilling had been the victim of misapplied sentencing guidelines, a ruling that made inevitable a reduction in his sentence. Skilling's resentencing was delayed for years, however, as he fought to overturn his convictions. He has consistently maintained his innocence.In 2010 the supreme court ruled one of Skilling's convictions was flawed and that prosecutors had overreached themselves using the \"honest services\" fraud law. But that decision did not lead to a retrial, as Skilling had hoped. In May prosecutors brokered a deal with Skilling to reduce his sentence in return for the end of his appeals and an agreement to forfeit the seized assets.Enron's collapse wiped out more than $2bn in employee pensions, $60bn in Enron stock and cost thousands their jobs. The $40m seized by the government will be distributed to victims of Enron's fraud.\"The investigation and prosecution of [Skilling] has been ongoing for more than 10 years,\" the agreement stated. \"The government has invested extraordinary resources into this case during a lengthy investigation, pre-trial litigation, trial and extensive post-trial litigation before the District court, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. In the absence of this agreement, the parties anticipate substantial ongoing litigation. By the terms of this agreement, [Skilling's] convictions will become final.\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Former chief executive could be released before the end of the decade

This route moves through the deserts, austere and verdant landscapes, mostly wild and unpopulated, an itinerary with ample promise of getting lost, travelling in time and undergoing inadvertent epiphanies.Texas and New Mexico have deep-rooted, large and rapidly growing Hispanic populations (Texas 38.1%, New Mexico 46.7%, in the 2010 census), and both are \"majority minority\" (an oxymoron much in use), indicating that a majority of people are from non-white ethnic groups. You're a\u00a0majority, but you're still minority.This reconquista has brought a tide of new, transforming ways of understanding our history and this very geography, that lately is attracting artists and visionaries from all parts.This is my widescreen homeland, encompassing my birthplace (San Antonio, Texas) and my longtime spiritual refuge (the Jemez wilderness of north-west New Mexico), a land I've long harboured an inexplicable sense of belonging to. I first sensed this attraction travelling there with my family as a 14-year-old. Coming from parched south Texas, north-western New Mexico seemed impossibly alpine, its primordial forests fragrant, mysterious and sheltering.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tEl Santuario de Chimay, New Mexico Photograph: Arnold Drapkin/ZUMA Press/Corbis\n\t\t\t\n            \nJose Lim\u00c3\u00b3n, the director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame, in Indiana, calls the region \"Greater Mexico\", preponderantly Hispanic and uniquely forged in all the epics of North America \u00e2\u0080\u0093 indigenous genesis, the conquest and colonisation of Mexico, myriad migrations and the revolutionary birth of the United States.The Texas state capital of Austin (only founded in the 1830s) sits on the fault line separating Anglo and Hispano worlds, ever touting its difference, if still harbouring a wariness of fully embracing all things Mexicano.Growing up in San Antonio (founded in 1718), the comparatively rural redoubt of shipwrecked Texan Mexicanidad, Austin was our Athens up the road, an eclectic gathering place where auspicious hippy world wisdom was dependably in foment. Then, it was the prophetic psychedelia of Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators rock band; the searing postmodern blues of Townes Van Zandt. The sounds and words of ZZ\u00a0Top and Willie Nelson, blues-y, rebellious and rough-hewn, were ubiquitous, familiar and fitting for the time.In the summer of 1979, making a pilgrimage to the now long-gone venue of the new Austin sound, the Armadillo World Headquarters, it was Talking Heads (Fear of Music tour), with the B-52s opening. The world was changing. These days, at Waterloo Records you might hear the psychotropic songcraft of Dav\u00c3\u00add Garza on the sound system, mantric drone rock from The Black Angels, or the post-punk siren songs of Alejandro Escovedo or Spoon.Austin's hardscrabble Texas Hill Country setting belies its blessed geographic location, a city conjured over the Edwards limestone aquifer, filtering precious rainwater into a vast underground reservoir. In such an arid, unforgiving land, cooling springs abound, from Barton Springs in the city to Krause Springs in nearby Spicewood (don't miss Opie's Barbecue there).An hour west is the 6m-year-old Enchanted Rock, a massive, pale-pink granite pluton dome with peaks jutting out from a sandy valley of mesquite trees. It beggars belief the first time you see it; many say it's a\u00a0sacred place.We climbed and circled the hoary igneous batholith like it was David's Jerusalem or the very Ka'bah. The vista spans miles in every direction, surveying tiny mesquite stands, specks of cattle, a few dusty ranch houses in the distance. If you're not a poet when you climb it, you might be one when you descend.For my family, San Antonio was the cradle of antiquity, a secret Mexican city, on American soil. It was founded in the last push of the Spanish colonisation of Mexico, early in the 18th century. A constellation of beautifully restored missions on the modern city's Southside echoes these distant origins. The legendary Alamo, living testimony to how badly an immigration policy can go awry, was itself a Spanish mission.During the Chicano movement, activists and intellectuals reclaimed Texas and New Mexico as Aztl\u00c3\u00a1n, the mythical land from which the Aztecs came, an old homeland rediscovered. San Antonio imparted a different way of being American, open to identities emerging from the deep time of these lands \u00e2\u0080\u0093 indigenous, Hispanic, Anglo and beyond.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tUFO festival in Roswell, New Mexico Photograph: Ted Soqui/Sygma/Corbis\n\t\t\t\n            \nMy preferred road to New Mexico is Highway 90, through Castroville, Hondo (full of Santos family members), and Uvalde, careening then into the astounding desolation of West Texas. Past Del Rio, there's Seminole Canyon State Park, where you must hike down into the deep canyon to view ancient, indigenous stone wall paintings depicting a people in pilgrimage. It's testimony to how long people have journeyed across these lands, long before there was a border to be policed.Marfa has become a cultural destination of late: hipsters heading out there as if the tap water gives you visions. I don't get it. There's a great radio station (KRTS), bookstore and a\u00a0cafe next door with a fantastic green chilli, but I prefer to head south to visit Presidio and Ojinaga, which is on both the US and Mexican sides of the border.From there, I climb into the nearby mountains to Chinati Hot Springs, an exalted desert oasis. On an open plain, you can soak in a stone tub fed by a steaming geothermal spring under the vast, glimmering heavens, meteors streaking by.Spaniards ventured into the lands that became New Mexico in the late 16th century, searching for mythical cities of gold. Santa Fe was founded in 1609, Albuquerque 1691. A sense of the mythical is there today. Nearing Albuquerque, there's Alamogordo, where the first nuclear bomb was tested in 1945, or Roswell, where in 1947 extraterrestrial visitors famously scuppered a flying saucer in the desert.After graduating high school, some chums and I backpacked into the craggy, mountainous pine forests of the Jemez wilderness, west of Santa Fe. The landscape is pocked with hot mineral springs to soothe intrepid trekkers (nature bathing is a big draw on all my road trips). We ended up at Fenton Lake, a limpid blue mountain pond, finding a bustling movie set for Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth. It's the lake where David Bowie's quixotic alien character, Thomas Jerome Newton, splashes down and later builds a wickedly cool Atomic Ranch-style manse.My New Mexico has always been a place of such surprises. Living rough for a week on the streets of Albuquerque on that trip, my comrades and I were welcomed by a myriad of strangers who shared their chilli-pork stews, beers and tequila \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that was just for breakfast.    \n                \n\t\t\t\tA view of the Enchanted Rock, Texas. Photograph: Peter Tsai/Getty Images/Flickr RF\n\t\t\t\n            \nDubbed the \"Land of Enchantment\", there's a presence of the mystic in New Mexico as common as the spicy scent of pi\u00c3\u00b1on. There's a mingling of the very old and the new. With its adobe facades, Santa Fe feels like a metropolitan pueblo, even as it's home to the Santa Fe Institute, where post-quantum physics and chaos theory have been nurtured.In 1987, I journeyed to Chaco Canyon where you see the ruins of a\u00a0city that sprawled along the canyon\u00a0walls, abandoned by the Anasazi people in the 6th century BC. I was making a documentary about the \"harmonic convergence\", a\u00a0global new-age Woodstock, marking\u00a0the beginning of the last segment of the much-vaunted Mayan calendar. Three thousand devotees showed up, chanting, drumming, dancing and visiting the sunken circular kivas where native people still worship and\u00a0leave offerings. It was yet another\u00a0meeting of worlds.My last trip to New Mexico was in 2001, over days that included the events of 9/11 in my then hometown of New York. My companion and I had set out from Jemez Springs to visit the museum of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos. Along the road that morning, we silently followed the radio news as the two towers of the World Trade Center fell. At the Los Alamos Historical Society, exhibits about the region's indigenous origins sat alongside the history of the bomb and the blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.In these lands, on these roads, you can't escape a view of the world through the long span of time, the lessons ever the same, ever new.John Phillip Santos is a film-maker, producer, journalist and author\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 For more

Saturday to give urgent military support to Western-backed rebels, aiming to stem a counter-offensive by Assad's forces and offset the growing power of jihadist fighters. Assad's recapture of the strategic border town of Qusair, an effort spearheaded by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, and an expected assault on the divided northern city of Aleppo have alarmed supporters of the Syrian opposition. The US administration has responded by saying, for the first time, it will arm rebels, while Gulf sources say Saudi Arabia has accelerated the delivery of advanced weapons to the rebels over the last week. Ministers from the 11 core members of the Friends of Syria group agreed \"to provide urgently all the necessary materiel and equipment to the opposition on the ground,\" according to a statement released at the end of their meeting in Qatar. The statement did not commit all the countries to send weapons, but said each country could provide assistance \"in its own way, in order to enable [the rebels] to counter brutal attacks by the regime and its allies\". The aid should be channelled through the Western-backed Supreme Military Council, a move that Washington and its European allies hope will prevent weapons falling into the hands of Islamist radicals including the al-Qaida-linked Nusra front. Ministers from the Friends group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which includes Western and Arab states as well as Turkey \u00e2\u0080\u0093 also condemned \"the intervention of Hezbollah militias and fighters from Iran and Iraq\", demanding they withdraw immediately. As well as fighting in Qusair, Hezbollah is deployed alongside Iraqi gunmen around the Shia shrine of Sayyida Zainab, south of Damascus. Iranian military commanders are believed to be advising Assad's officers on counter-insurgency. Two Gulf sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia, which started supplying anti-aircraft missiles to the rebels on a small scale two months ago, had accelerated delivery of sophisticated weaponry. \"In the past week there have been more arrivals of these advanced weapons. They are getting them more frequently,\" one source said, without giving details. Another Gulf source described them as \"potentially balance-tipping\" supplies. French military advisers are training the rebels in Turkey and Jordan, sources familiar with the training programmes said. US forces have been carrying out similar training, rebels say. Rebel fighters say they need anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons to stem the fightback by Assad's forces in a civil war that has killed 93,000 people, driven 1.6 million refugees abroad and cost tens of billions of dollars in destruction of property, businesses and infrastructure.Louay Meqdad, spokesman for the Supreme Military Council, which is led by former Syrian army general Salim Idriss, said it had received several batches of weapons. \"They are the first consignments from one of the countries that support the Syrian people and there are clear promises from Arab and foreign countries that there will be more during the coming days,\" he told Reuters Television in Istanbul.     \n                \n\t\t\t\tUS Secretary of State John Kerry and Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, after a ministerial meeting on Syria, in Doha, Qatar. Photograph: Str/EPA\n\t\t\t\n            \nA French diplomatic source said Paris would increase non-lethal aid such as communications equipment, gas masks, night-vision goggles and bullet-proof vests. It would also provide assistance with military strategy and battlefield intelligence. \"All this has already started,\" a Western source said. \"Broadly speaking, Western nations will do this, while Gulf Arab nations will deliver the weapons. It's a division of roles. If the northern front receives enough material and non-material support quickly, it could soon be equivalent to thousands of men, or even tens of thousands.\" Idriss himself told Al-Jazeera International television on Saturday that his men were still lacking \"effective air defence\" against Assad's planes and helicopters. \"That's why we are asking for shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and anti-tank missiles, modern ones with long range,\" he said. \"We need it yesterday \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 because the regime is trying to recapture the whole country.\" The increasingly sectarian dynamic of the war pits mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against forces loyal to Assad \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who is from the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and has split the Middle East along Sunni-Shia lines.

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/22/obama-approval-rating-fall-polls", "text": "\n\t    The mainstream media panic over the CNN/ORC poll showing President Obama's net approval dropping 17pt to -9pt is over. Pew Research came out with a survey giving Obama a 6pt net favorable rating among adults \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only down 2pt since its prior survey. The truth is that the drop is likely in between the two polls, as I noted on Wednesday. I, however, want to focus on an overlooked split from the Pew survey: Obama's net approval rating among all adults at +6 versus registered voters at -2. It's not difficult to see how these two data points present different pictures. One paints a president who enjoys relatively broad support among the public, while the other one says he's actually not popular. The question is whether one point is \"righter\" than the other one and whether it means anything. It's part of a long standing debate that Mark Blumenthal covered well in 2010. Most national surveys start with an adult sample. The reason is quite simple: it's very easy to know what the adult population looks like thanks to the census. So when you randomly call up all households, as most public polls do, you have a known parameter. This leaves less room for error. There is no set registered voter parameter that everyone can agree upon*.Polling among all adults has the additional advantage of allowing us to know how all Americans feel. This may sound corny to some, yet it's important to point out that the government represents all Americans, not just those who vote. If a pollster's job is to allow politicians and us to know what's important to the people, then polling adults is the way to go.The problem, of course, is that elections are not fought among all adults. Only registered voters can cast a ballot, and only some of them do. The politicians that I know are most interested in getting reelected. Historically that might not have been a problem for displaying results among adults, but adults who are not registered these days tend to be more favorably inclined toward the Democratic party.You saw this split in action last year. Because young voters and Hispanics were the most likely to not be registered, President Obama enjoyed a 10pt greater advantage among all adults than the smaller pool of registered voters. That's quite a wide split and very similar to the 8pt difference in Obama's approval rating among the two groups right now per Pew.   Other pollsters don't have nearly as wide of a contrast between the two groups, but it's apparent**. YouGov's latest survey shows a 3pt difference, while the Washington Post last month had it at 4pt. The reason could be that Pew does a better job than most of reaching farthest corners of the electorate who are the least likely to respond to a survey or vote.Still, 3 to 4pt would be enough of a difference for the following adult surveys \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Bloomberg, CBS/New York Times, Gallup, National Journal and NBC/Wall Street Journal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to turn from a positive net approval to an even or negative net approval among a registered voter subsample. You can also probably subtract a few more points if you project a likely electorate for a midterm electorate, which is even whiter and older. These are important distinctions for electoral purposes in the upcoming 2014 elections. More so than any time in recent history, the president's party's fate in midterm elections seems to be linked to president's own standing. In 2006, President Bush's approval was only 43% in the exit polls. His party got 44% of the House vote. What about in 2010?In an average of adult polls with undecideds allocated in the prior two weeks before the 2010 election, 49.5% of Americans approved of Obama's job. That's still a negative net approval rating of -1pt, yet a 1pt deficit in the national House race would have been small enough for the Democrats to hold onto the House given incumbency advantage. So then how did Republicans win the House? The electorate that voted wasn't all adults. In 2010, President Obama's approval was 44% in the exit polls. His party got 45% of the House vote. Indeed, in every instance from CNN to Gallup to Pew to the Washington Post to YouGov, the gap in approval among voters and all adults in pre-election polls was mirrored in the ballot test between the Democratic and Republican candidate.Thus, we're back where we started. Neither approval of registered voters or adults is perfect. Adults are easier to poll, and we know how the entire country feels. Of course, registered voters are the ones who can vote, and polls of them have tended to be accurate even if individuals lie about their registration. It also seems a registered voter sample of Obama's approval rating, which paints a worse picture for the president than approval of all adults, probably gives us a better idea on how the 2014 midterms will play out.*One way to know that a respondent is a registered voter is to call a list of known registered voters like most campaign pollsters and Public Policy Polling. The disadvantage is that these lists tend to not to cover all voters. The advantages of lists versus randomly calling households is a hotly debated topic. **It should also be pointed out that it's not rare to see in any one poll that adults and registered voters have the same approval for Obama, though, it is unusual and likely because of sampling error.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Harry J Enten: The approval among registered voters is far

the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who admitted leaking top secret spying documents.As Snowden landed in Moscow after leaving Hong Kong, where the US had requested his arrest, leading Democratic senator Chuck Schumer accused the Russian president of sticking a finger in the eye of the US. \"The bottom line is very simple: allies are supposed to treat each other in decent ways and Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran and now of course with Snowden,\" Schumer said on CNN's State of the Union. \"That's not how allies should treat each other and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.\"Mike Rogers, chairman of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, told NBC's Meet The Press that he did not have information that Putin had prior knowledge of Snowden's flight plans but \"it wouldn't surprise me\". \"Putin has been planting a thorn in the world's side in Syria. We think they may not be playing honest with respect to the nuclear treaty. They are very aggressive around the world,\" he said. \"I'm sure they would love to have a little bit of coffee and some conversation with Mr Snowden.\"He added that the US should use \"every legal avenue\" to bring Snowden back to the US. \"We will continue with extradition activities wherever he turns up.\"Rogers said the leaks had damaged national security and \"bad guys overseas have changed the way they operate\" as a result of the leaks.Republican senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News that Russia should \"hold this fellow and send him back here for justice\".\"I don't think he's a hero, I believe he hurt our nation. He compromised the national security program designed to find out what terrorists were up to,\" he said.However, amid the backlash against Russia, politicians and others also rounded on the Obama administration. Graham questioned why Snowden was allowed to leave Hong Kong in the first place. \"I'd like to find out why our papers were not in compliance. That would be a big mistake by the Department of Justice,\" he said.Republican senator Rand Paul attacked national intelligence director James Clapper, who earlier this month admitted to gibing the \"least untruthful\" answer to Congress when asked about the extent of US surveillance of American citizens.Paul told CNN: \"I think it is still going to be an open question with history about how this young man is judged. I do think when history looks at this they are going to contrast the behaviour of James Clapper, our national intelligence director, with Edward Snowden. Mr Clapper lied in Congress in defiance of the law in the name of security. Mr Snowden told the truth in the name of privacy.\" He said both had broken the law.On Saturday House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi was booed by a crowd during a speech at activist meeting Netroots Nation when she said Snowden had broken the law. Pelosi was heckled as she spoke about the need to balance privacy and security. One man yelled: \"It's not a balance, it makes us less safe.\" Another shouted: \"You suck!\"\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Senator warns Vladimir Putin of 'serious consequences' if

But there has to be debate", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/21/gchq-surveillance-civil-liberties-debate", "text": "\n\t    In June 2008, the head of the US National Security Agency, Lt Gen Keith Alexander, visited Menwith Hill, the giant listening station near Harrogate in Yorkshire, and set the audience of British and American intelligence staff a provocative challenge: \"Why can't we collect all the signals all the time?\" he asked. \"Sounds like a good summer project for Menwith.\" The tone sounds almost jaunty \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it meshes with a similar and entirely serious ambition revealed in internal documents from within GCHQ, the sister UK organisation charged with monitoring communications \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mastering the internet. MTI for short.\"All the signals all the time.\" Until comparatively recently, such an ambition was the stuff of fiction and Hollywood. Now we are forced to confront the reality that we are moving into a new age of human existence where every digital action \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be it by phone, text, search, chat or email \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can be collected, searched and stored. The implications are profound. The pace of technological change is more rapid than the law or oversight can possibly cope with. The gravitational pull towards total surveillance is as inevitable as it is secret.There is a clear and powerful security justification for employing every available technological means to have the potential to track everyone, always. The first duty of a state is to protect life, and securocrats can plausibly argue that the ever-advancing capability of interception means that we can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds. The bad guys \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be they drug dealers, paedophiles or terrorists \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will (some of them) be caught in this boundless dragnet. Don't confuse the haystack with the needle. Nothing to hide, nothing to fear.The corollary of this approach is that there must be complete secrecy about the existence of the capability. Anyone who reveals it or discusses it will simply alert the bad guys, who will then change their behaviour. The system depends on a vast and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at least in Britain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 unprecedented infrastructure of secrecy,  including closed courts, private hearings, confidential commercial undertakings and restrictions on the ability of the British media to say or write very much about it at all. The less debate, the happier the government and the intelligence agencies.But there has to be debate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and over the past fortnight in America and Europe there has, indeed, been a vigorous discussion sparked by the revelations of the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden. Under what laws is this combination of state and commercial surveillance authorised? What are the processes for giving authority for building this gargantuan digital haystack \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then for finding the needles within it? In a world of such secrecy who can meaningfully oversee and audit such an infinite trawl of data? Do lawmakers understand the utterly changed circumstances in which legislation designed for an era of crocodile clips on copper wires is being stretched to cope with legions of engineers and analysts with the world literally at their fingertips? Numerous voices have engaged in that debate, from the US president himself to Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who spoke so impressively at the Olympics opening ceremony. \"Unwarranted government surveillance,\" he said last week, \"is an intrusion on basic human rights that threatens the very foundations of a democratic society.\"He's right. Mastering the internet may seem desirable and harmless to some in a comfortable era of coalition politics and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 still \u00e2\u0080\u0093 comparatively benign economic conditions. But a three-hour flight from London will take you to places where there is much less political and social stability. We are creating a system of total surveillance which could, indeed, bring great benefits in terms of security but which, in the wrong hands, could severely curtail protest, reporting, privacy and hard-won freedoms of association and speech. That much is at stake.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Editorial: The less debate about the shift towards total surveillance, the happier the government and intelligence agencies.

Martin said on Saturday that prosecution audio experts who point to Martin screaming on a 911 call moments before he was killed will not be allowed to testify.Judge Debra Nelson's written ruling was released after hearing arguments during a multiday hearing on whether to allow testimony from two prosecution experts. One expert ruled out Zimmerman as the screamer and another said it was Martin. A defense expert argued there was not enough audio to determine who the screams were coming from. Zimmerman's attorneys also argued that the prosecution experts' analysis is flawed.Opening statements are set for Monday in the second-degree murder trial for the former neighborhood watch volunteer, who says he fired on the unarmed black teenager in self-defense last year. Zimmerman is pleading not guilty.The screams are crucial pieces of evidence because they could determine who the aggressor was in the confrontation. Martin's family contends it was the teen screaming; Zimmerman's father has said it was his son.Audio experts from both sides testified at different times since the admissibility hearing started last month. Voice experts were hired by lawyers and news organizations to analyze the calls, which were made during the confrontation between the two. The experts arrived at mixed conclusions. In deciding whether to admit the voice-recognition technology used by prosecution audio expert Tom Owen, the judge had to determine whether it is too novel or whether it has been accepted by the scientific community at-large.\"There is no evidence to establish that their scientific techniques have been tested and found reliable,\" the judge said in her ruling.Owen was hired by the Orlando Sentinel last year to compare a voice sample of Zimmerman with screams for help captured on 911 calls made by neighbors. He said Zimmerman's voice doesn't match the screams. He only compared Zimmerman's voice to the 911 calls because he didn't have a voice sample for Martin at the time.\"The screams don't match at all,\" Owen testified during the hearing. \"That's what tells me the screams aren't George Zimmerman.\"Owen also testified that remarks Zimmerman made in a conversation with a police dispatcher aren't a racial slur. He testified that Zimmerman said, \"These fucking punks.\"Expert Alan Reich testified in a report for prosecutors that the screams on the 911 tapes were from Martin and the defense does not want him to testify at trial. Reich's analysis also picked up words that other experts couldn't find. They include the words, \"This shall be\" from Zimmerman and \"I'm begging you\" from Martin.In contrast, a British audio expert testified for the defense that it would be extremely difficult to analyze voices by comparing screaming to a normal voice. \"I've never come across a case in my 13 years where anybody's tried to compare screaming to a normal voice,\" said Peter French.A second audio expert for the defense, George Doddington, also criticized prosecution experts who said Friday that screams and pleas on a 911 recording likely belonged to Martin. \"It's all ridiculous,\" Doddington said.\n    ", "og:type": "article", "og:description": "Debra Nelson releases ruling after hearing arguments over analysis of 911 call recordings in Trayvon Martin murder case", "freqs":
